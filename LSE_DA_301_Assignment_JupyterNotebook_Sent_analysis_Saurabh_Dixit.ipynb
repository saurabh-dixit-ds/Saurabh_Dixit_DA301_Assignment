The fact that 50% of this space is wasted on art (and not terribly informative or needed art as well) makes it completely useless. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars and not 1 was that, technically speaking, it can at least still stand up to block your notes and dice rolls. Other than that, it drops the ball completely.  \n",

       "      <td>Eminent Domain is a game by Seth Jaffee, published by Tasty Minstrel Games.  It is for 2-4 players.  In this game, players will be building an empire in space.  They will be surveying new planets to colonize or they can take them over through the use of warfare.  They will also be producing and trading goods while researching new technologies.  The player that gains the most influence for their empire will be declared the winner.\\n\\nTo begin, the board is placed on the table.  All the role cards are separated into stacks and placed on the board except for the Politics cards.  One of these is given to each player.  Players then receive a warfare and 2 of the following cards:  colonize, research, survey and produce/trade.  Players are randomly dealt a starting planet tile which is placed in front of them face down.  The remaining start planets are returned to the box.  The planet cards are shuffled and placed face down near the board.  Players are randomly dealt a player aid.  The player that receives the aid with the start player on the back of it becomes the first player.  The influence tokens are placed near the board, setting aside the 8 tokens that are different colored.  The technology cards are separated by type and sorted by cost before being placed face up in 3 different piles near the board.  Players now shuffle their starting cards and draw 5 from their deck.  Play now begins.\\n\\nOn a player's turn, they will each perform 3 phases; action phase, role phase and cleanup phase.  The first phase is the action phase.  This phase is optional and can be skipped if the player chooses to.  In this phase, the player may play a card from their hand and resolve it's action effect.  Survey cards allow you to draw 2 cards from your deck.  Warfare allows a player to either collect a fighter token or attack a planet by returning a number of fighter tokens and flipping over a planet in the player's empire.  Colonize cards allow a player to colonize by placing a the card under a planet in their empire or to settle a planet that has the correct amount of colonies already on the planet.  The produce/trade card allows a layer to either add a resource token to an empty slot on a planet or to return a resource for 1 influence token.  Research allows a player to remove 2 cards from their hand from the game.  This helps to thin down the player's deck.  Politics allows a player to trade it for a different role card.  The politics card is then removed from the game.  Some technologies also have actions which do different things, depending on the card.\\n\\nThe next phase is the role phase.  In this phase, the player leads one of their role cards by choosing a card from the board and playing it in front of them.  The card may then be boosted by adding additional cards from their hand with matching symbols.  The role effect is then resolved along with the leader bonus, taking into account the number of symbols used to boost the role.  The survey role allows a player to look at 1 fewer than the number of survey icons played and add it to their hand.  Leading allows them to look at 1 additional card.  The warfare role allows a player to collect fighters for each symbol used.  Leading allows the player to attack a planet instead of collecting fighters.  The colonize role allows a player to place 1 colony per icon under a planet in their empire.  Leading allows them to settle a planet with sufficient colonies under it instead.  The produce role allows a resource to be produced on empty slots for each icon while the trade role allows a resource to be traded for 1 influence for each icon.  Leading in either produce or trade allows no bonuses until the stack is depleted, then it adds 1 icon of the appropriate role.  The research role allows a player to take a technology card and add it to their empire, assuming they have the prerequisite planet(s) and enough research icons to pay for it.  Leading in research provides no bonus until the stack is depleted.  Like the produce/trade role it then gives an additional icon at that point.  When the player finishes with leading their role, the remaining players in turn order may either dissent or follow.  Dissenting allows them to draw an additional card from their deck.  Following allows them to play cards from their hand that match the symbol of the chosen role and perform the role effect without the leader bonus.\\n\\nThe final phase is the cleanup phase.  In this phase, the players discard any played cards and the active player may then discard any additional cards that they would like to.  They may then draw cards till their hand limit is reached.  Play then passes to the next player.\\n\\nThis all continues until either the influence supply or a number of role card stacks are depleted, depending on the number of players.  In a 2 or 3 player game it only takes 1 stack, while 3 and 4 player games require 2 stacks depleted.  Scoring then takes place.  Players add up their influence from any influence tokens gained and from face up planets in their empire as well as any technology cards with influence on them.  The player with the most points is the winner.\\n\\nCOMPONENTS\\nThis game has some really great components.  The board has clearly defined places for each stack of role cards much like Ascension's board does with it's cards.  The different role cards have bright colors and icons on them.  I almost wish that they would have had some different artwork along with the role icons but it makes sense with the game so I'm not complaining.  The planet cards are really cool looking.  They have that great space feel like something from Star Trek.  The starting planet cards are less like cards and more like thick tiles which makes them easy to pick out from the others.  The technology cards have some truly breathtaking artwork on them that I seriously love.  The resource tokens are all brightly colored for each of the different resources and are thick wood.  The influence tokens are thick cardboard and they look nice as well.  The player aids are thick cardboard like the start planet tiles.  I especially like that the start player is easily determined through handing out these tiles.  It's a very ingenious idea.  Of course the coolest part are the plastic fighter tokens.  They come in 3 sizes and each one is fantastically detailed.  I love just looking at them.  As I said, each piece is great and of very high quality.  This is one amazing looking game.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nRULEBOOK\\nThe rulebook for this game is very pretty to look at.  Each page is printed in glossy color.  There are tons of great pictures including how to set up the game.  Everything is easy to read and understand without any problems.  Each of the roles and actions are defined in great detail.  There is even a glossary of certain terms that are used in this game.  Also included are some game play variants which are for extended 3 player games and the learning game for new players.  I think that the best part though has to be the last page which shows a quick reference guide for all the technologies available in the game.  It really shows off the beauty of these cards.  I really love the look and feel of the book and find it to be as high quality as the components.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThis  game is a load of fun.  It's pretty well known that I love a good deck building game and this one does not disappoint.  It's absolutely fantastic.  I really love how the theme really works in the game and makes it feel like you are building your own space empire either through colonization or warfare.  I really feel like a cross between a Starfleet Captain and the Empire as I either colonize or attack planets, adding them to my cause.  The technology cards really help to amp up your engine that you build through role selection.  Much like other deck builders, this game changes with your chosen cards through your particular play style.  The game is not that difficult and can be learned fairly easily.  Of course some of the terms might be a little confusing the first time so it's recommended to play the learning game.  We decided not to do that and jumped straight in to the full game.  I'm glad that we did as we really had no troubles at all.  My son loved the theme as did I and we both love the game play.  I mostly concentrated on warfare whereas he relied more on colonization.  After seeing me conquering planets left and right he began to turn his attention more to warfare as well.  Needless to say, this was the first stack to be extinguished.  The only complaint about gameplay that I could come up with was that every one of the players started with the exact same deck to begin with.  Of course this is fixed with the Escalation expansion that will be reviewed at a later time, so I won't really go into that here.  In any case, the game is truly amazing and we all love it.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nOVERALL\\nEminent Domain is a light to medium weight deck building game full of strategy.  It can be played in about 45 minutes but will probably take over an hour for the first play through.  It did for us anyway.  The setup is quick and choosing first player is really simple through the use of the player aid tiles.  I love the artwork and find the theme is really integrated quite well.  It feels like you are creating your own space empire.  Everything from the cards to the plastic fighter tokens looks amazing, although I kind of wish that there had been more of that great artwork on the role cards instead of the large icons.  It's not that difficult and is fairly easy to learn.  Fans of deck building games like Ascension or card games like the Star Wars LCG should thoroughly enjoy this game.  I absolutely love it and find myself wanting to play it every opportunity that I can.  I highly recommend it.  It brings out my inner Starfleet Captain.  \"Space, the final frontier...\".\\n9 out of 10</td>\n",

       "      <td>When I first heard about Days of Wonder's newest game, Ticket to Ride (Days of Wonder, 2004 - Alan Moon), I was excited. But how could I not be - for all of Days of Wonders games so far have been fabulous, and it seems that each successive game gets better and better. And Alan Moon with a train game (shades of Union Pacific) sounded like a winning combination. I had an opportunity to play the final version of the game, and was quite impressed with how the game looked.\\n\\nAnd is the game any good? The short answer is that once you play this game, you'll never play TransAmerica again. It's a fantastic medium-weight game - one that plays equally well with two to five players. The components are superb, the artwork is great, the game is downright fun (and nasty sometimes), and the total package is a very strong contender for the Spiel des Jahres 2004. (which it won!) After my first playing, I ranked it an 8; but after multiple playings the rating moved up to a 9, then a 9.5 - and if I keep playing the game at this rate - may move into my top ten list. Game play is very tight, and I found that game scores can run very close - making for an exciting game, all the way down to the finish.\\n\\nEach player receives forty-five train cars in one color, and places a matching round token of that color on a scoring track. A large board is placed in the middle of the table, with a map of America (circa late 1800's) superimposed upon it. Thirty-six cities are there, each connected by one or two \"railroad lines\". These lines are made up of one to six spaces, and are one of eight colors: purple, yellow, black, white, green, red, blue, brown, and gray (neutral color). A deck of \"tickets\" is shuffled, and three are dealt to each player. Players may discard one of them, but must keep at least two of them. Each ticket has two cities on them, and a point value that a player will receive if they connect those two cities, or lose if they don't connect the cities. The remainder of the ticket cards are shuffled and placed in a face down pile next to the board. A pile of train cards is shuffled, and four are dealt to each player. The remainder are shuffled and placed next to the board, then five of them are turned over and placed face-up next to the draw pile. The player who has traveled the most goes first, and then play continues clockwise around the table.\\n\\nOn a turn, a player may do one of three things. They may draw two cards, one at a time from either the face-up cards and/or the draw pile. Each card shows a different color of train car - matching the eight different colored spaces on the board. There is twelve of each color car in the deck. There are also eighteen \"locomotive\" cards, which function as wild cards. When a player draws a face-up card, the card is replaced immediately before they draw another card. A locomotive card counts as two cards if drawn when face-up, but only one if drawn when face-down. If there are ever three locomotive cards face-up at any time, all five cards are immediately discarded, and five new cards are drawn. If the cards run out, the discard pile is shuffled back to form a new draw deck.\\n\\nThe second thing a player may do is to draw three ticket cards. They must keep at least one of them, but have the option of keeping all of them, if they like. The others (if any), are discarded.\\n\\nThe third thing a player may do is play cards to place their train cars on the board. A player may play one through six cards of the same color (including wild cards), to place the same amount of train cards on a corresponding line on the board. For example, Las Vegas is connected to Salt Lake City by an orange line consisting of three spaces. Three orange cards must be played to put three trains of that player's color on those spaces. No more players could then place anything between those two cities, and if players want to connect those two cities with their lines, they'll have to go around the long way (if possible). Gray lines can have any color cards played to place trains on them, but the cards played must match the number of spaces in the gray line, and all of the cards must be the same color. When placing trains, the player doing so receives points - 1 point for one train placed, 2 points for two trains, 4 points for three trains, 7 points for four, 10 points for five, and 15 points for six trains. Some cities have two lines connecting them, both of which can be used in a four or five-player game. In a two or three-player game, however, once one of these lines has been used, the other cannot.\\n\\nWhen one player, after taking their turn, is down to two train cars or less, the final round begins. Starting with the player to their left, each player has one final turn, and then the game is over. The trains on the board are counted to make sure that the points were totaled correctly during the game, and then ticket cards are revealed. If players can trace a continuous path between the two cities on their card with their color train cars only, they receive the points, and move their tokens accordingly. Otherwise, they lose the points, and must move their token down the scoring track that many points. The player who has the longest continuous track also gets ten points. The player with the most points is the winner!\\n\\nSome comments on the game...\\n\\n1.) Components: As usual, the components for Ticket to Ride are supreme. Days of Wonder has, by far, more superior components for their games than any other company. The board is fantastic, with a nice map, and when the train cars - nice plastic cars in bright colors - are placed on it, the whole thing looks pretty fantastic! The cards are of the highest quality, and are about half the size of normal playing cards. Each color card not only has a different train car on it, but they have symbols in the corners to help differentiate between the colors (good for the color blind). Everything fits into a wonderful plastic insert that is in a beautiful, sturdy box - the same size as Days of Wonder's other Big Box Games.\\n\\n2.) Rules: The rules are only four pages - large, colorful, illustrated pages - but only four! The game is being printed in many languages - and has the distinction of being the first major game release that I know of that has been produced in Korea, something which is rather dear to my heart. The game can be explained in about 5 minutes, and I am very pleased at how easy it is for people to pick up. Even people who have a hard time understanding simple games (\"No, John, you cannot attack people in Settlers of Catan!\") had an easy time picking up the game - and I was amazed at how fast strategies were picked up.\\n\\n3.) Strategy: When I first was taught the game by Eric Hautemont, CEO of Days of Wonder, I didn't think that strategy would be that important. Then, he beat us, scoring 162 points to my 82, and my friends 54. I was floored! I thought that I was doing well, during the game, but realized several things that I missed afterwards. I found out in the game that there are different strategies, and was impressed with how they differed. One can ignore their ticket cards and just try to place long trains, hoping to get a lot of points. Or one can try to complete as many ticket cards as possible, not worrying too much about how long of trains they place on the board. Then, there is the middle ground - but is a compromise of the two strategies enough to win? Not to mention the fact that players must watch other players, and occasionally place trains to mess them up.\\n\\n4.) Cutthroat: This gives the game a real \"cut throat\" atmosphere. Sometimes the best move for a player is to place train cars between cities they don't care that much about - just to stop another player - either from getting the longest chain of cars, or completing their tickets. This can cause some enmity, but it's all in good fun, and I really enjoyed the player interaction - from taking cards to placing trains.\\n\\n5.) Holding cards: It's fun to get a big hand of cards (there is no upper limit). Players try to hoard cards so that they can place long trains of cars, scoring the big points. Also, players must always keep in mind that everyone else is watching them, trying to determine where they are going. The longer a player keeps the cards in their hand, the less they tip their hand. However, if one player suddenly uses up all their trains, causing the final round, and you are stuck with a huge hand of cards, it can be quite devastating. My wife found this out the hard way. She was about to connect three cities that would complete two of her tickets - probably winning the game. Another friend of mine, in the same game, had the same problem. Either one of them could have won the game, but because they held the cards just one turn to long - they lost. Of course, I was the evil guy who caused the game to end, but I got my just desserts, losing by only one point to yet another player - and the winning point was caused by her having the longest continuous train of cars.\\n\\n6.) Fun Factor: And yet, even with the bluffing, and the other little nasty tactics, the game is extremely fun. The decisions are short, causing the game to move quickly, but can be quite stressful at times. Yet these decisions really make the game fun! Blocking someone else off, using your own lines, pulling two locomotives from the draw pile, or finally connecting those two cities - all of this adds up to a wonderful time of fun!\\n\\n7.) Time and Players: The game runs quickly, because the decisions are important, but don't bog the game down to much. I was impressed with how well the game scaled, but found that the two-player game was much different than a five-player one. Both were fun, but needed different tactics.\\n\\nAs you can see, I really enjoyed this game. I think it has strong possibilities of being one of the best games of the year. Alan Moon has always been one of my favorite designers, and this is one of his best games in years. Days of Wonder has put a lot of time and effort into producing this game, and it shows. When I first played TransAmerica, I thought that it was a boring game -what was the point, and where was the strategy? Fortunately, the strategy and fun in this game are wonderful. I don't need a \"dumbed-down\" game to introduce new folks to the wonderful world of board games. I can just use games like this - tremendous, fun games, filled with tactical choices and enjoyable times.\\n\\nTom Vasel</td>\n",

Regardless...\\n\\nDungeons &amp; Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1\" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.\\n\\nWhat it is:\\nWoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.\\n\\nSome of the adventures feature \"chambers\", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.\\n\\nIt's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.\\n\\nIt's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.\\n\\nWhat it isn't:\\nA deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.\\n\\nA completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules.\\n\\nOverly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)\\n\\nWhat's in the box:\\n* 42 plastic heroes and monsters\\n* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles\\n* 200 encounter and treasure cards\\n* Rulebook\\n* Scenario book\\n* 20-sided die\\n\\nMiniatures:\\nThe game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&amp;D Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.\\n4/5\\nCardstock Dungeon Tiles:\\nThey're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&amp;D Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&amp;D game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)\\n5/5\\n200 Encounter, Monster &amp; Treasure cards\\nThese are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.\\n5/5\\nRulebook:\\nThe rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.\\n3.5/5\\nScenario Book (\"Adventure Book\")\\nThis has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&amp;D, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.\\n4.5/5\\n20 sided die\\nAKA, the d20. THE iconic D&amp;D symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&amp;D Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.\\n5/5\\n\\nOverall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one \"solo\" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.\\n\\nI actually wouldn't mind running a full D&amp;D campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.\\n\\n*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes. Setup per adventure doesn't take nearly as long (maybe 2-3 minutes)</td>\n",

       "      <td>The USA version of Ticket To Ride is fun but frustratingly cutthroat; I would not recommend getting the base set without the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1910-Expansion/dp/B000K8FYAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion&lt;/a&gt;, which offers three superior variants, more tickets (routes) and regular sized playing cards to replace the tiny ones included in the base set. The main problem with the base set is that whoever builds the big northern routes usually wins, exacerbated by the awarding of a \"longest route\" ticket worth bonus points. The 1910 expansion offers you the choice of eliminating the longest route bonus and awarding a \"most routes completed\" bonus instead, or using both of them, or neither. That helps tailor the win condition to best suit the group.\\n\\nHowever, I still prefer the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ticket-to-Ride-Europe/dp/B000809OAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Ticket to Ride Europe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1912-Expansion/dp/B002OFLL7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;because of it provides more interesting challenges (ferries and tunnels) and adds stations players can use to get around being cut off in completing their routes. These stations can easily be used in USA or other versions. Europe still has the \"longest route\" bonus points award but this is easier to get for everyone because if you have to use a station to complete a route ticket, it no longer counts toward your getting the longest route award.\\n\\nAnother excellent option over the USA version is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-To-Ride-Marklin/dp/B000EYF7RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Days of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Germany) version that adds passengers you can use to score crazy bonus points that add a whole new strategy to the game; unlike the stations in Europe, however, the passenger mechanic is not easily integrated into other editions. Another nice thing about Marklin is that it offers the most balanced map with a near equal distribution of long and short routes which are split up on the left and right sides of the vertical map. With Marklin, completing a ton of short routes is just as viable a win strategy as long routes in the USA base sets.\\n\\nBoth Europe and Marklin also split your initial ticket allotment into long (blue-backed) and short (brown-backed) routes; you get to choose how many of each you want to do--unlike the USA base set, which is totally random in its ticket distribution (long routes are harder to complete but offer more bonus points to win than short routes).\\n\\nI also enjoy the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ticket-to-Ride-Switzerland-Map-Expansion/dp/B000WTDUZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Ticket to Ride Switzerland Map Expansion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-Nordic-Countries-Board-Game/dp/B001E9641K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\"&gt;Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries Board Game&lt;/a&gt;. Both Switzerland and Nordic Countries are designed for only 2-3 players, unlike the usual 2-5) so they are great options for smaller groups. They also offer the two most challenging maps.  Unfortunately, Switzerland is out-of-print and online sellers are charging a fortune for it.  You can play it and the USA and Europe versions online, however, for a much more reasonable cost (live opponents or vs. the computer).  I've played the online version almost 1,000 times since August 2010 but I still love playing the board games.  They are my favorite board games of all time!\\n\\nOne thing to watch out for, in my opinion, is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes. That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets, a new way to score bonus points, and two variants: Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride: USA). However, I still prefer the maps and additional challenges (like building ferries and tunnels) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.\\n\\nNo matter which version you pick, if you know how to play one, the others are easy to pick up, and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.\\n\\nTicket To Ride is, in my opinion, the best light strategy (or \"gateway\") game on the market to bring family and friends together.  Actual game time may vary depending on the number of players, their familiarity with the maps and rules, and how quickly they can strategize and complete their turn (most turns are finished in a minute or less but some could last up to 5, especially when choosing additional route tickets). I'd say every version of Ticket To Ride (even with expansions) takes about 60 minutes on average but a game could last anywhere from 30-120 minutes (the difference between having 2 players vs. 4-5, for example, and/or if some newbie players need rules or strategy help, or are just really bad at making decisions and revising their strategy on the fly).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.\\n\\nAcquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes\\n\\n*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.\\n\\nAcquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.\\n\\nVersion &amp; Components\\n\\nThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.\\n\\nI need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.\\n\\nSome people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.\\n\\nPrevious versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.\\n\\nGame Mechanics\\n\\nThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.\\n\\nIn Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.\\n\\nWhen a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.\\n\\nPlayers continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.\\n\\n1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"\\n\\n2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.\\n\\n3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.\\n\\n- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.\\n\\n- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.\\n\\n- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.\\n\\nThe acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.\\n\\nAt the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.\\n\\nThe Review\\n\\nAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.\\n\\nI focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.\\n\\nIt seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.\\n\\nThe kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.\\n\\nI personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I went camping as kind of a chaperone with a youth group and learned to play this game at a picnic table.  The occasional breeze made so many stacks of card perilous, but it would have been too warm in the tent.  I was enthralled: surveying planets that would be subdued either by force of amassed fleets of fighters or more subtle attrition with one colony at a time.  I was producing and trading resources for points, and researching new technologies that- as I think of it- seldom improved the quality of life for my empire- some of the most expensive ones are game changes though all this from the comfort of a picnic bench.\\n\\nGame Play\\n\\nThis is a role-based game similar to Puerto Rico.  Where one player chooses a role and does the action then others get to do it too, though not with the same bonus as the person who chose the role.  Its also a deck building game like Dominion only the number of cards to choose from is always the same and is much smaller.  This leads to how the role portion is different.  The more often you choose a role, the stronger you will likely be when you choose that role again in the future.\\n\\n My Canadian friends might at the point say, Eh?  (read: Please explain or huh?) Lets take surveying planets: before you can grow your empire youve got to find planets in the vastness of space.  The way its handled is you draw as many cards from the planet deck as one less than the number of survey cards in your hand.  Got three?  You draw 2 planets.  Look em over, consider and weigh them and then pick the won you want to show up in your empire.  Letss say you chose the role of survey, well you get to add a survey card to your hand, now you have four! You can pick and choose from more planets now, leading to better planet discoveries.  The poor guys who don't have at least two survey cards in their hand can abstain and draw a card from their deck to help them for the next role selection.\\n\\nThe roles are:\\n\\n*Survey  Described above\\n\\n*Colonize  One method of making a survey planet one of yours for points, trading opportunities, or other bonuses.\\n\\n*Warfare  Second method surveyed planets become yours\\n\\n*Produce/Trade  How you make or sell goods for points\\n\\n*Research  Buy cards to add to your hand that help in role phase for either of two roles\\n\\nPrior to choosing a role, you have an action phase.  This is when you can actually subdue planets.  Or use a research card to trash cards from your deck so they won't come up again.  Used in the action phase, the survey card will let you draw two new cards.\\n\\nThere are a few end conditions.  You run out of point tokens, or two piles of role cards are depleted.  There is a last up opportunity till you get back to the start player.  So everyone gets the same number of turns- even extra victory tokens (different color) that can be earned during those turns.\\n\\nAs I said, points can be earned by selling goods and by subduing planets, but also by possessing of some research cards.  Whoever has the most at the end wins.\\n\\n I hate to tell you what to do but\\n\\nMultiple paths to victory is the name of the game.  Ive won going heavy on subduing planets, pushing an early game end producing and trading goods like crazy once I had four or five planets.\\n\\nSomething to watch out for when colonizing a planet, don't embark on one that you don't have enough colonize cards for.  These cards get tied up with the planet card and you need on in your hand during the action phase to finally flip the planet over.  If they are all tied up there, youll never be able to seal the deal.  (ok, you can buy a research card, and wait for it to be shuffled into the deck and finally be picked up.) or you could just watch out for that sort of thing.  The warfare method doesnt tie up cards- being a bit safer.\\n\\n Theme\\n\\nPerhaps its apparent that I get caught up in the game.  The little fighters are awesome and sometimes get flown from where they were amassed to the planet they are subduing before they get returned to the supply because, by gum, Im in space!  Theres never any battle, just a threshold that needs to be met to subdue.  The planets are pretty the cards are gorgeous.  The resource chips, though variously colored to represent different resources aren't limiting if someone is hoarding them, but they are kind of plain.  I suppose you might take this out of space and then you are looking for islands to conquer instead?  Man-o-wars are probably more expensive to make than the little fighters.\\n\\n Balance\\n\\nMost games have felt pretty close that Ive played.  You may look over at someones empire and see they have many more planets than you but hopefully you are thinking, yeah, but my stack of tokens from trade is a lot bigger than his while the third guy is smiling about the points from the technology cards.  If you are woeful, and you might be your first time, then if the shoe fits\\n\\n Interaction\\n\\nThis game encourages interaction.  Youve got to tell people what role you are doing so they can do it too.  But after that, my empire might as well be in a parallel universe.  I cant survey your planets.  I cant send my ships to your planet to steal your or destroy your goods, let alone take your planet and pleasantly trade with you.  That would be a fantastic expansion, says I.\\n\\n Learning Curve\\n\\nMedium.  At least when Ive taught people the idea of tapping a card to affect the roll before or after it happens seems to be a sticking point, mostly because there are only two kinds of cards that go before a roll and you are used to tapping all the rest of the cards after you roll.  Once you get past that, then theres the analysis paralysis for those who struggle with the idea of multiple routes to victory.  Which of all those cards should I try to get?  Happily the opening options are limited.  The options increase as people warm up to the game- hopefully getting the hang of it.\\n\\n Downtime\\n\\nNot much at all.  You are either getting a new card or doing a role.  Sometimes it takes a while for them to choose their action and unless they announce what role they are doing you could see them doing an action and jump the gun.  But\\n\\n Whats not to Like?\\n\\nThe prude in me strikes again: My permanent marker helped me a bit with the Artificial Intelligence card.  Really?  I grinning guy looking forward to time with a metal-clad winking female shaped robot?  Except the forced interaction previously described, its even more solitaire-like than Puerto Rico.  At least there you can shaft people by claiming a boat or two and cause them to throw their goods in the drink or buy the building you know the other guy needs or sell the good to the trader they have so they cant.  Yes, thats how I play that game.  I like to think of it as defensive playing.  Yeah, thats it.  But no room for that in this game.  I guess my mom should really like it.  I guess there could be a race for the really cool tech cards but thats pretty weak.\\n\\n Adaptations\\n\\nDont let the wee ones touch it- ok, theyve played with the fighters and the 1/8 thick planet cards.  Ive bought two copies of the game so that up to 8 can play.  And I think- for an expansion that you should be able to scout neighbors planets and trade with them and attack them.  Add a card called planetary defense that lets you beef up defenses on a planet.  If you trade with a surveyed planet you get two points and put the good on their planet and they can sell it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>If you only employ one creativity-enhancing resource for the rest of your life, make that resource the Ball of Whacks!\\n\\nBreakthroughs in effective creativity-inspiring methods seldom occur.  Most \"new\" methods are simply restatements or reshapings of ideas that flourished among the ancient Greeks (such as Heraclitus, a favorite source for Mr. von Oech) or before.  Those who are familiar with the earlier work usually don't gain much from the newer approaches.  The Ball of Whacks is a happy exception.  Heraclitus would say that you can never interact with the Ball of Whacks twice in the same way.  And he would be right.\\n\\nThe most valuable creativity-enhancing methods I've experienced usually require having a team work together, with one of the tasks involving making little models or prototypes of creative concepts.  I often find myself wishing I could have those experiences more often . . . but seldom having the right people and time to pursue that desire.\\n\\nThen, I discovered Roger von Oech's Ball of Whacks. Wow!\\n\\nMy frustrations are now behind me.\\n\\nThis is day 8 of working with the Ball of Whacks.  It's been quite an education.  I can hardly wait to find out what I'll learn on day 9!\\n\\nWhen you first see the Ball of Whacks, you won't quite know what to make of it.  Open the box, take out the ball, the magnetic stand and the workbook.\\n\\nThen, let yourself go.  Discover what the ball is.  To the geometrically inclined, you'll notice that it's a rhombic triacontahedron (try saying that 5 times fast!), a ball-like shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  The ball feels somewhat alive, however.  It gives when you squeeze it and resumes it shape when you stop squeezing it.  As soon as you take out a piece, you'll discover that the ball is composed of 30 design blocks that use magnetism to adhere to one another.\\n\\nAs you take the pieces apart, the ball disappears and many regular and irregular shapes occur. Usually, that's the end for me.  I can never recover the original shape (my Rubik's cube is still a mess!), but the ball is easy to reform (if I can do it, you can too).\\n\\nI like abstract shapes and I was pleased to find that the magnets act both to attract and repel the pieces. Unlike Lego pieces, connections can be made in all kinds of odd ways.  I also noticed that the pieces often reshape themselves, almost organically, as they choose a different connection than the one that I initiated. The casual results are often better than my planned ones.\\n\\nBased on a suggestion in the workbook, I began mixing in other objects that could be held by the design blocks.  The results were infinitely more interesting and rewarding than anything I'd ever created before.  I felt a great sense of peace from the experience.  Many people had told me I would like sculpting, but I lacked the confidence to try.  With the Ball of Whacks, I felt like a super sculptor . . . but without any lessons.\\n\\nAfter several days of working on abstract shapes, I decided to try geometric shapes.  These were paradoxically harder to do in many cases.  The magnetism sometimes fought me.  I had to design clever solutions to create the regularity I wanted to see.\\n\\nI also left the Ball of Whacks out to see what others would say.  Everyone noticed that I kept changing it.  Without thinking, rewarding new designs would emerge in a few seconds.  I gained confidence in my creativity involving forms.\\n\\nAt the same time, I was working on a number of non-physical problems.  Soon, I began seeing metaphors in the blocks and my designs for those problems.  New and better solutions began to flood my mind.\\n\\nFeeling like I should read more of the workbook, I now found myself intrigued by the directions for how to use the Ball of Whacks to expand my creative repertoire.  I began to see huge gaps between the methods I prefer to use, gaps that I could easily explore and understand with my new appreciation of my creativity habits.\\n\\nBest of all, the lessons are deeply ingrained.  The human nervous system is mostly made up of connections between the hands and eyes to and from the brain.  By both holding and seeing what I was working on, the exercise connects more parts of my brain and experience.  I find totally different memories being stimulated, especially those from the sandbox and while playing with modular toys.\\n\\nToday, I went back and totally redid a book proposal I'm working on.  I was astonished to see that my mind was connecting those little blocks from The Ball of Whacks into new ways of assembling the pieces of the proposal.  I would never have expected that.\\n\\nWhat does the name mean?  I don't think there's just one meaning.  It obviously sounds like \"ball of wax\" which is something that warms and becomes malleable in our hands.  I'm reminded of the red wax that you peel off of Edam cheese to form shapes.  At another level, a \"whack\" in von Oech's vocabulary is a way of getting you to let go of artificial assumptions.  In that sense, this is a tool to give you lots of whacks.  And it does.\\n\\nI haven't done all of the exercises yet, but I plan to.  Each of the ones I've done has been quite an eye-opener.\\n\\nHere's a tip.  Turn off the TIVO while you're watching television and use the commercial breaks to play with the Ball.  The baseball playoffs are excellent for this purpose because you get all kinds of short delays.\\n\\nBe smart.  Give a Ball of Whacks to each of your children rather than purchasing another toy.  You'll inspire genius that will constantly fascinate you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This is an in-depth review of the product \"Robotech RPG Tactics Starter Board Game.\"\\n\\n1) OPENING THE BOX\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice about Robotech: RPG Tactics is the sheer size of the box: it's over 11 inches long, 11 inches wide, and 6 inches tall, so it takes up a lot more space than an average Parker Brothers or Fantasy Flight Games box.  When you open the lid, you'll see that it's covered in gorgeous artwork depicting battles between the United Earth Defense Force and the Zentraedi Armada.\\n\\nThen you'll look inside the box, and you'll notice how much stuff is inside.  There's over 20 plastic sprues, which will allow you to assemble 5 Veritech Fighters, 5 Guardians, 6 Battloids (1 extra, I guess in case you screw up), 2 Tomahawks, 2 Defenders, 12 Battlepods, 1 Glaug, 1 Quel-Regult, and 1 Quel-Gulnau, which I didn't recognize from the series but is apparently a Zentraedi \"Recovery Pod.\"  There's also over 50 stat cards (they are sort of laminated, but I wouldn't risk writing directly on them), 24 Robotech-themed 6-sided dice (12 UEDF, 12 Zentraedi), 20 infuriatingly small command tokens, a blue artiller template, 2 decal sheets that will give you flashbacks to your childhood, and 1 decent-sized, full-color rulebook.  There's almost TOO MUCH stuff.\\n\\nUnlike Warhammer 40,000 or Warmachine's \"starter board games\", there's enough in this box that you'd never need to buy anything else (I'm sure you'd need two or three boxes if you wanted to play in a Robotech RPG Tactics tournament, but as I mention below, this isn't really a \"tournament\" game).  Of course, there's a flyer in the box that advertises all of the cool stuff you COULD buy - it seems there are plans to release some of the more obscure Macross saga mecha, followed by the Masters Saga and New Generations machines at some future point - but the rulebook is full of plenty of scenarios you can play using just this box set.  You're also not going to want to buy anything else after getting this box, at least for a little while.  This thing takes forever to put together.\\n\\n2) PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER\\n\\nLet's not beat around the bush: the average number of pieces you'll need to assemble one if these playing pieces is TWENTY.  \"Big deal\", you say, \"I can put together Space Marines in my sleep.\"  Not so fast, these are much more similar to Japanese Gundam models than typical gaming miniatures.  You're going to be using an X-acto blade to cut these brittle plastic pieces (think the material used to make Lego bricks, but thinner) from their sprues, filing down seams, filling in gaps, and praying to God you don't glue your fingers together.  Getting this game ready to play will take more than a couple hours.  We're talking at least a holiday weekend... longer if you plan on doing the kinds of customization that will make this product look truly exceptional.\\n\\nIf you consider yourself an \"expert\" at assembling tiny plastic model kits, this product will challenge you to create some of the most beautiful figurines you can imagine.  Give yourself three hours to cut and reposition limbs, and you'll be able to recreate any pose the Valkyries take in the show.  If you have a pin vise and a can of GluBoost sitting in front of you right now, and you love Robotech, then go ahead and add this product to your shopping cart, because Robotech RPG Tactics is your playground.\\n\\nHowever, if you consider yourself a \"beginner\" or even \"intermediate\" hobbyist, then these models are going to frustrate you.  Whoever designed this product made several legitimately horrible design choices: they gave the models amazing potential at the expense of accessibility.  In fact, if you've never used model clippers and superglue to put together a model kit, I would suggest you stay far, far away from Robotech RPG Tactics, because you'll end up with a bad impression of the hobby.\\n\\n3) PLAYING THE GAME\\n\\nAfter playing the story-based missions from the rulebook, I think this game does a great job simulating the \"feeling\" of Robotech/Macross.  The Valkyries dart around the battlefield, switching forms in response to the flow of battle.  You'll immediately notice how different a Valkyrie operates in each of its three modes, and each mode offers its own distinct advantages and disadvantages (it's not quite so simple as \"fighters can move the greatest distance\"; they actually HAVE to maintain forward thrust every turn, they follow strict turning requirements, etc.).  Regults play like expendable footsoldiers - they have a rule called \"life is cheap\", and Khyron can gain temporary bonuses by killing his own men - while Glaugs provide their squads with an increased range of command options.  There are special things Valkyries can do when they are \"in formation\", but they can also split up and try to flank the enemy forces.  On any given turn, Rick will fire missiles at a squadron of Regults, the Regults will try to shoot them down, the surviving Regults will shoot back at Rick... and then you can choose whether Rick dodges, attempts to \"roll with it\", or Ben dives in front of Rick and takes a bullet for him.  Each turn, both players are given a set number of \"command points\", which can be used to accomplish feats of improbable heroism or villainy.\\n\\nOverall, the rules provide an extremely cinematic game experience.  At times, you'll feel like you lost because your opponent outplayed you; at other times, you'll feel like you only won because of dumb luck.  You'll rarely feel like the rules are unfair; however, you'll often feel like the rules are fun at the expense of clarity.  For instance, in tournament miniature wargames such as Warmachine, the rules clearly delineate when you can measure the distance between two models, and when you can't.  In Robotech RPG Tactics, you're allowed to measure whenever you want, but the rulebook gives a friendly reminder that, sometimes, frequent measuring and re-measuring can bog down the game's pace.  Although this kind of thing didn't seem like a serious problem to me or anyone I played Robotech RPG Tactics with, I know from past experiences that many miniatures wargamers, especially those who like to play in tournaments, want rulebooks to be as specific as possible.  For those kinds of wargamers, Robotech RPG Tactics may seem unpolished.\\n\\n4) FINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nRobotech RPG Tactics was produced by the role-playing game company Palladium (famous for games like \"Rifts\", which emphasize tone over mechanics) and the young-and-hungry miniatures designers Ninja Division (famous for producing a number of anime-themed, \"you either love it or you hate it\" games such as \"Relic Knights\" and \"Tentacle Bento\").  Perhaps this is why the components Ninja Division produced - the miniatures - are best enjoyed by experienced hobbyists looking for a challenge, while the components Palladium produced - the rulebook, the stat cards, etc. - are best enjoyed by Robotech fans who have been waiting years to play a Robotech board game, but may not have much experience with Robotech RPG Tactics' competitors such as Battletech or Heavy Gear.  I think that if you are interested in Robotech or robot model kits enough to consider buying this product, you should go for it.  Even if there are parts of Robotech RPG Tactics you feel could have been done better, you'll feel like you got enough Robotech merchandise to justify the price tag.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The game is easy to learn and explain. One person draws a card and selects a question from it to read out loud. Everyone else writes down an answer that they think the reader will think is the best answer. All of the answers are played face up, and the reader secretly selects the one they like best. The other players now try to guess which one the reader picked. Players score points for writing the winning answer, voting on the winning answer, and the reader gets points for people guessing right. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Apples to Apples (the playing and picking answers), Wits and Wagers Family (the betting aspect), and any one of a number of party games that rewards you for knowing the other players well or provides an opportunity to get to know each other better. While that may sound like a bit of a mash-up, it plays very smooth and really hit the sweet spot for us.\\n\\nThis game is about the experience, but here's a few quick thoughts about the rules/components/etc. I appreciate that this game is easy to teach, and that you really can just jump right in and play. No one seems to have any questions, it's nice when the rules just blend into the background and the focus is on fun. I really like that each card has three possible questions and the reader gets to choose which one to pick. Aside from increasing replayability, this is an opportunity to direct the game a bit, avoid something you don't want to talk about, or explore what the other players might think you think on a fun topic.  This is the type of game you could really play for any length of time, but the scoring system seems to have the game play out for just the right amount of time. I did miss the meeples though! We love betting with the meeples in Wits &amp; Wagers Family, and with the art of the game showing meeple images I found myself looking through the box a couple times to try to find them. There are tokens that are used instead, but I like the meeples better and wish they had been included in this game as well.\\n\\nWits and Wagers Family was a big hit with my extended family over the holidays, so I was really excited to give Say Anything Family a try at a recent family get together. I was able to easily convince my mom and grandma, my aunt Judy, and my uncle Rob to give it a try. This game had us laughing, groaning, telling stories, and having fun together right from the get go. We were grossed out by the idea of kissing a urinal, imagining what the best part of being a dog is, pondering how lottery winnings would be spent, discussing who would be the most fun to have dinner with (Gene Simmons in full costume?!!?), and laughing about what the weirdest family secret might be. We kept a causal pace throughout the game, with lots of conversation and smiles. It really was an amazing experience, and I'm looking forward to many more plays. It was a big hit, and we ended up with a phenomenal 12 thumbs up, everyone loved it!\\n\\nRandy\\nGrowing Up Gamers</td>\n",

       "      <td>I needed that route!  You just cut me off, now instead of destination cards giving me gobs of points, now they all count against me.  Theres no way around!  My nerves have never felt more vexed than they do now.  Thats Jane Austin speak for: Im seeing red and now Im going to do anything I think might hurt your chances for the rest of the game; and the next one we play!\\n\\n Ok, so the first time this happens, theres usually another way around, its probably the long way around, but hopefully you have enough trains to make it, because thats a constraint you have to work under.\\n\\n Game Play\\n\\nThis handsomely illustrated elongated board looks has a map of the United States dotted with notable cities that are connected by short and long lines of rectangles (or tracks).  In line of track is one of several colors.\\n\\n You start the game with some cards in your hand that are nicely illustrated train cars of the same several colors.  Each turn you either\\n\\n  take you can draw two cards from either some face up cards or roll the dice and choose some from a facedown draw pile, or a combination.  If you pick a wild from the face-up pile, you only get one card that turn.\\n\\n  buy a route (lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities)  You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains.\\n\\n  Draw three Destination Cards.  Youve got to keep at least one.  These give a method to the madness of which routes you buy.\\n\\nAs you lay down your trains you rack up points, The longer the track, the larger the gain.  If you successfully complete the route on your destination card, you also rack up points, but those you conceal till the end of the game.\\n\\n The game ends a full round after someone has fewer than four trains- everyone but the catalyst gets another turn.\\n\\n Points are scored as Ive said, but those destinations you weren't able to complete, yeah those count as negative points.  Oooo.. ouch.\\n\\n I hate to tell you what to do but\\n\\nKeep an eye on how many trains your opponents have left, don't be stupid and fill your hand with destinations when you won't have time to complete them.\\n\\n If it looks like a route you need is one that your opponent might need, you have a vested interest in getting there first, even if its an easy one.\\n\\n You may even consider drawing more destination cards for your first turn or two so that you can spend more time in the game working on more that are related. Than getting those you start with and drawing more in the middle of the game.\\n\\n What does related mean?  Consider the following routes:\\n\\nLA to Miami (goes from the south-east corner of the US to the south-west corner)\\n\\nNew Orleans to Duluth (goes north and south through the center of the US)\\n\\nSalt Lake City to Houston (goes from the western US to the south-center)\\n\\n Because there could easily be much overlap in the first and third route, but not the second route, Id dump the second route and keep the other two.\\n\\n Theme\\n\\nWell, several off-shoots from Ticket to Ride have come.  Not to mention an expansions for the original game that adds several smaller routes.  So there is evidence that the theme can be slanted, but in Ticket To Ride Europe, game play is the same with some twists, like you can use someone elses route for your destinations sake without getting points for the route, and you route requiring tunneling through mountains are more pricey.  These off-shoot stand alone games are a good way for Days of Wonder to charge full price for what could have been a less expensive expansion to the existing game.\\n\\n I can hear you say, Yeah, but they are boards in different venues!\\n\\n Yes, they are, but Rio Grande seemed to be able to offer double-sided boards (Yes, that means two new maps) and new rule sets for Power Grid for less than half the cost of the original game.\\n\\n Oh...  Really?\\n\\n Yup.  But for comments to the theme itself, I think the original game is pretty strong.  Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking, especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection.  Ive got lots of little trains!  Cool little plastic trains!\\n\\n Balance\\n\\nWhile I often complain about chance and this game includes card, the fact that you don't have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it, and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps.  Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with.  Tit for tat.  Anyway, for having cards, I have no complaints.\\n\\n Interaction\\n\\nInteraction is low.  While verbal congrats are possible, expressions of dismay and indifference often follow someone laying track.  If you cant reach the cards, there will be- give me those two oranges or, how about two off the mystery pile of joy!  But as I think of it, this game could be played in silence.  So if you are entertaining that favorite group of mine to pick on- introverts, you already knew what you were in for.\\n\\n Learning Curve\\n\\nLow.  The purchase price card you get tells you how much things cost and the production of a square base on die roll and Robber operation are pretty easy.  Each development cards has what it does written plainly on it.  While the rules are easy, the options are pretty limited and objective is pretty straightforward.\\n\\n Downtime\\n\\nNominal.  While you do have to wait your turn, there is a possibility that the track you want to buy gets bought on someone elses turn.  If you pay attention you can make groans at the time they will pay off the most.\\n\\n Whats not to Like?\\n\\nI cant think of anything bad to say that I haven't already said.  Its a great game that has done much good for the industry and I trust the makers are raking in mega bucks with all their spin offs.  If people are willing to pay, they deserve it.  Ah, the beauty of capitalism.  I guess there are eccentric people out there, who are happy to shell out another $35 to $50.\\n\\n Collateral Endorsement\\n\\nI haven't come across a soul who didn't like this game, but you may say that my social circles are small.  You are probably right, but I love growing them with games.  My kids love to line up the trains from here to there, but they have severed my board in one place, so beware, the (read: any) board is best set up on a table rather than the carpet floor where wee feet are won't to walk.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Newest update: My daughter is now 6.5, and I still think this is one of the best things I've bought on Amazon.  We recently saw one of those horrible ASPCA commercials, and she asked if we could send money to the \"dogs in cages.\"  She's got the money, so she gets to make those choices.  I love that about this system.  She has donated money to the WWF twice.  If I were to do it all over again, I think I would just commit to $3 per week ($1 per container) - I didn't think that would add up fast enough, but $2 per week has added up way faster than it needs to, and so she doesn't fully understand scarcity.  Even so, she has a much better understanding of money than she would otherwise, and basically has for as long as she can remember because we started this when she was just 4.  Her little sister is 2.5, I'll be buying another one of these when the younger one turns 4.  I don't think there's anything special about the bank itself (by the way, it has held up perfectly - I was afraid the rubber band would lose its elasticity over time, but it still holds the pieces together strongly), but the system is solid, and one of the aspects of parenting that I actually feel like I'm doing right.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNew update:  It's been a year, my daughter is about to turn 5, and I'm still really excited about this bank.  We took her \"share\" money and looked at charities online.  She chose to give to the Word Wildlife Fund, which has a cool thing where if you donate a certain amount of money, they'll send you a stuffed animal of the animal that you choose to sponsor.  She's definitely still no expert of money, but she's doing really well for her age, and understands when I say things like \"we can't afford this,\" or \"let's save up money for that.\"  Great, great purchase.\\n\\n---\\nUpdate:  We've now had this about 5 months.  She has used her \"spending\" money to buy stuffed animals at the zoo (which are super overpriced - but now I don't worry about it, that's for her to figure out!), and we opened up a bank account with her \"save\" money.  I honestly am so glad we are doing this.  She has a much, much better grasp of money, and what it means to spend it or save it.  We are going to do the \"share\" portion close to the holidays, when I will let her choose a charity.  She already is looking forward to that - I don't know how much she understands yet, since we haven't done it, but she will.  But in the past several months, watching the money grow, opening a bank account, using her \"spending\" money - this has been a really, really fantastic item.\\n\\n---\\nI have been wanting to start to get my daughter to think about money, and saving it for what she wants.  I didn't know if 4 was too young (she just turned 4), but she understood immediately that she needs to start holding onto money so that she can buy a stuffed animal flamingo at the zoo.  Additionally, she is super motivated now to do things for money.  I debated whether or not I wanted to have this be a part of our routine - money as a reward, learning how to save/spend/etc. so early - but it has been fantastic.  She doesn't quite grasp the \"spending\" and \"sharing\" parts yet, but I can tell that she will soon.  I intend to wait until she has a decent amount saved up, then open a bank account where we can deposit it, and use the \"share\" money on a charity of her choice.  The book suggests putting the majority of the money into \"spend\" and only 5% into the other two, but we do 1/3 1/3 1/3.  Why not?  For now, it's working great.</td>\n",

Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!\\n\\nThe book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.\\n\\nMy daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.\\n\\nOne thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!\\n\\nWe made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.\\n\\nPros:\\nGreat, easy directions\\nNice supplies in the kit\\nVariety - you can make so many types of dogs!\\nFun project to do with your kids\\nThe finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals\\nKids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives\\nLots of room for creativity\\nYou can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store\\nPrice - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store\\nAmazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great\\nThis kit would make an awesome present for any young girl!\\n\\nCons:\\nThe glue: this kit is a lot more fun if you invest in a hot glue gun\\nMore money :) if you love this kit as much as we do, you'll end up spending a lot more in the craft store to keep going with it!\\n\\nI hope you have as much fun with this project as we have!</td>\n",

       "      <td>As a dad of two boys Im always on the lookout for activities for us to do together.  Something we can all enjoy and equally get into.  We built a Da Vinci catapult, a siege tower, did some exploring with microscopes, geocaching, etc. with varying degrees of interest in one of the two boys.  Dont get me wrong we all had fun, but it was more for one or the other depending on the activity.  My older son, since the day he could, has loved to talk.  He loves to tell stories about things hes done, things hed like to do, or things hes watched.  If he can make a story out of something, he will.  My younger son has, since I can remember, loved to play board games.  There are ones he likes more than others but I don't think weve played a game he didn't like.\\n\\nI recently became aware of a card/board game by a company out of the UK named Cubicle7.  The game is called Hobbit Tales: From the Green Dragon Inn and it looked very interesting.  Cubicle7 also makes a RPG that takes place in the same world as this game called The One Ring.  The cards in this game can be used with that RPG if desired, so its all very integrated.  The basic premise of the game is that the players are hobbits sitting around a table at the Green Dragon Inn telling stories of their adventures.  The game takes place in rounds (one for each player) and they tell the story with the aid of Adventure Cards (75 of those).  Each adventure card has a story aid, something to inspire the story teller, a title and a Tolkien quote, along with some excellent artwork to really inspire you.  However the other players have similar cards called Hazard Cards (40 of those) that they use to try to throw the story off.  Things like a goblin patrol, or a group of brigands.\\n\\nThis is the real magic of the game, when the players interact with each other in the telling of their (or each others) story.  The goal of course is to score the most points of course but the fun isn't in winning or losing the game at large.  We always count up the points and figure out who won, but thats just sort of a whatever moment.  We really enjoy the interaction and getting to tell a well flowing complete story and the opportunity to interject into others stories to tell a bit of the narrative ourselves.\\n\\nOf course there are rules that govern when you can play a hazard card, and how you decide if the hazard card was effective, but the rules are so simple it really took no more than a few minutes to get a full mastery of the games rules.  Thats a neat feat all of its own.  Most board games require much more attention to the rules.  Dont I get to shouldnt he  type of questions that make you go back to the rule book and figure out how it works again.  Not so with this.  I haven't opened the rules book since the first read through.\\n\\nSo this game fits both of my boys perfectly.  I cant imagine them liking a game more.  Its a board game and the way you play is by telling stories.  Its almost as if the game was created specifically for my family (Im a LOTR nerd, I admit it).  Ive only had the game for 3 days now and already weve played it probably 10 times or more.  No matter how many times we play it its always different (due to the number of cards there are almost unlimited possibilities).  I imagine well be playing again tonight after dinner.\\nOh, and I didn't really get into the artwork on the cards.  It is fantastic.  Some painted; some more like pen and ink drawings.  All of which feels very much like what youd expect in a Tolkien inspired game.  I believe some of it is used in the illustrations in the One Ring manuals as well (the art direction of the game has the same feel even if the game is not the same type of game.\\n\\nIve been very impressed by the selections Ive seen from Cubicle7 so far.  Im going to have to look into more of their products rather than just the ones in my wheel house (again, Tolkien nerd here).  But do yourself a favor and find this game and buy it.</td>\n",

In Ticket to Ride, you play one of five different friends who are obsessed with  Phileas Fogg, the man who went around the world in 80 days.  Based on Fogg's story, the players make a one million dollar bet to see who can make it to the most cities in seven days.  In the game, players can do one of three different things on their turn to travel across America:  collect tickets, collect routes, or spend tickets to travel.  When a player collects tickets, they draw one or two tickets.  These tickets can be one of five revealed tickets or from the draw pile.  If a player draws a wild card from the revealed tickets that is the only ticket they can draw that turn.  When a player collects routes, they draw three routes and must keep one.  Routes are worth positive points if a player has connected the cities on the card at the end of the game, but, the card could be worth negative points if the player does not complete the route.  The last action a player can do is spending tickets to place trains on the board.  To place trains on a path on the board, a player must spend enough tickets of the same color as the path.  Some paths are gray and allow the player to spend any color ticket as long as they spend the same color tickets.  Each time a player places trains on the board, they earn points based on how long the path is.  Play continues until one player has two or less trains in reserve.  Then all players get one last turn, and then the game is over.  After counting points from route cards the player with the most points wins!\\n\\nTheme-I'll be honest.  I've played this game a lot, but, I didn't read the story until I finally bought the game.  The story reinforces the theme decently and helps makes the title \"Ticket to Ride\" make sense.  Some of the mechanics don't quite reinforce the theme as once you have a route it doesn't leave the board.  Do you get to keep the tickets you have for that route in the game?  Do you get to keep riding the trains for free?  Why can't other players ride the same train as me?  It's not perfect, but I do feel like I'm busy trying to make it across America as fast as I can. 3.5/5\\n\\nMechanics-Ticket to Ride has some of the slickest mechanics out there.  My simple summary above is almost all the rules you need to play the game.  The game is quick, fun, and family friendly for almost all ages.  Even though the game doesn't have the insane depth of some other games, a surprising amount of strategy emerges in this game.  Since goals are secrete, you never know when your best laid plans will go up in smoke.  That tension is amazing for a simple game. 5/5\\n\\nInstructions-The instructions are four pages.  Not four pages front and back, two pages front and back.  Since the rules are not complex, the rules don't need an epic to teach the players.  I do like the art and pictures that help to teach how to play.  Brevity is the height of wit with these rules. 5/5\\n\\nExecution-The box is nice and hardy.  The path indicators are cute plastic trains that are a nice addition to the game.  The board has a nice layout and is easy to read.  AND, I know the Days of Wonder LOVES me since the game comes with plastic bags for each player's components.  I absolutely love when a company does that! 5/5\\n\\nSummary-I love this game.  It's quick, family friendly, and always good to see making it to the table.  The theme is slightly off, but the mechanics, instructions, and execution of the game make up for that hands down.  Really worth trying if you get the chance. 92.5%</td>\n",

       "      <td>This game is extremely elegant, making it easy for those new to gaming to get into, but it also provides great opportunities for strategy that game lovers can appreciate. Everyone I have played it with says it was their favorite game of the night-- it is a true crowd pleaser.\\n\\nThe board is well designed- it is an oversized map of the U.S. with major cities, each linked by segmented lines of different colors. Around the edge of the board is a scoring metric, numbered from 1 to 100, to keep track of your points. Each player gets 45 plastic train cars of a given color, and a wooden cylinder of the same color to move along the scoring metric.\\n\\nEach player has two hands of cards. The first is a hand of cards with different train cars of varying color. You play a certain number of train cards of the same color to claim the \"routes\" (the lines between cities) of the same color. The second hand is made up of destination tickets. These tell you what cities you are trying to connect with your trains. These either award or deduct points from your score based on whether or not you complete them. They are kept secret until the game is over.\\n\\nThe elegance I mentioned comes from the simplicity of each player's goal (to link cities on a map using trains), as well as the simple structure of a players turn. On their turn, a player only has to do ONE of three actions: put trains on the board, draw more train cards, or draw more destination cards. You get points for the trains you place on the map, the destinations you fulfill WITH your trains, and a ten point bonus awarded at the end of the game for the longest continuous line of trains.\\n\\nHaving only one action to perform ensures players aren't wracking their brains to remember what to do each turn, and also encourages strategic thinking (if you take one action on a given turn, you have to wait til your next turn to take another). Choose carefully!\\n\\nThe educational value of this toy is twofold- you get the brain exercise of strategic thinking, and as an added bonus, you learn a bit of U.S. geography! I only marked down the durability because one of the train cars in my game arrived chipped. But they provide three extra cars for each color, so it's pretty much moot.\\n\\nAll in all, this game has something for everyone. It is simultaneously strategic and simplistic, and never gets so directly competitive that you get frustrated instead of having fun. Keeping your destination cards secret until the game is over is a great meachanic- those who scored many points by laying down trains might get passed up by those who completed more destinations, and the \"longest route\" bonus often becomes a determining factor in games. Everyone who plays is in the game the whole way through. \"Ticket to Ride\" has beyond earned the honor of \"favorite game\", and then some.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:\\n\\nTHEME\\nThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.\\n\\nCOMPONENTS\\nThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central \"bingo board.\"  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.\\n\\nSOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?\\nGlad you asked.  There's a few twists:\\n\\n1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.\\n\\n2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.\\n\\n3) After a company gets so large, it becomes \"safe\" in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.\\n\\nSO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLY\\nA few reasons:\\n\\n1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.\\n\\n2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.\\n\\n3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.\\n\\n4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is \"safe.\"  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.\\n\\n5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (\"I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?\"), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).\\n\\n6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.</td>\n",

Its fun to play while being educational and working on spelling as a child is always an important skill to have. Set Enterprises Inc. was kind enough to introduce me to several of their games during the 2013 ASTRA Toy Fair in Nashville, TN. I walked away with a copy of Quiddler Junior and they sent me more games later but it was this game that really caught my attention. I used to home school my daughter so I was very keen on checking this out and seeing its potential in mixing education and fun for the kids. That is a wonderful combination as anyone who has home-schooled can tell you!\\n\\nThe objective of Quiddler Junior is to earn the most points by spelling words from the cards in your hand. Its that simple!\\n\\nEach player starts with two cards. They draw one card from the draw pile or discard pile and then discard to end their turn. This continues until one player can use all of their cards to form a word and still discard a card to go out. Once a player goes out, each other player has one more turn to try to make a word and go out as well. After the round ends, the players words are scored with their point chips and a new round begins. Each round from here out will change by one card. In other words, the next round, each player starts with three cards, then four, then five etc.until the final round of seven cards to start with.\\n\\nWhen scoring a word, each card is worth the value of points show on its face. If a player cant score a word, they get a turkey (zero points.) There are no negative effects in this game unless a player fails a challenge. A player can challenge a word if they feel it isn't really a word. If they are wrong and it is in the dictionary chosen, then they subtract the total score of the word from their score and vice versa. If the player being challenged is wrong, then they lose the points.\\n\\nThere is also a five point bonus for the player with the longest word at the end of the game.\\n\\nAfter the last round, each player counts up all their point chips and the highest score wins!\\n\\nThere is also an alternate solitaire way to play this game included.\\n\\nNow I know this is a simple game, but it is supposed to be. It is for children. It is fast paced and it keeps the kids attention. The artwork is cute and is geared towards the young children. They will not only learn to spell from this game but also the names of objects and animals. They will learn to identify these things by picture while also learning to spell and it all being reinforced by all the resources combined. Its really a good learning tool and game.\\n\\nThis game is perfect for families with young children. You get to mix fun with learning and the kids love it! It doesnt get any better than that. Its also a great tool for home-schoolers or church groups etc. It fits well into a lot of applications for games.\\n\\nSet Enterprises is known for good solid games that are educational, fun and easy to learn. They make great travel games and Quiddler Junior is no exception.\\n\\nClub Fantasci Scoring (Based on scale of 10):\\n\\nArtwork:  7\\n\\nRules Book:  8\\n\\nRe-playability:  8\\n\\nComponent Quality: 7\\n\\nClub Fantasci Overall Score:  7.5\\n\\nI am giving Quiddler Junior 7.5 out 10 stars because it is a game that parents can easily play with children, still enjoy and teach their kids important skills at the same time. It is a very good childrens and family game.\\n\\nThis game is Club Fantasci Certified!\\n\\nCompany Website: http://www.setgame.com/Company\\n\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Set.

       "      <td>Originally posted at [...], a new idea everyday!\\n\\nGame-Eminent Domain\\nPrice-$40\\nProducer-Tasty Minstrel Games\\nSet-Up/Play/Clean-Up-1 Hour\\nTL;DR-Only a few faults make this game great instead of excellent. 87.5%\\n\\nBasics- Compete for the Galaxy!  In Eminent Domain, players take the roles of different groups trying to conquer the most locations across the galaxy.  This is a deck building game with a twist.  Each turn players do three things in order.  First, they can play a card from their hand as an action.  These actions either build fighters, settle planets, produce resources, removes cards from your deck, or other things.  Then, players draw one card from the central board as their role.  This new card goes into the players deck, hence the deck building aspect.  These roles produce/sell resources for points, settle attack or settle planets for points, research advanced cards with new actions, or search for new planets.  Here is where things become interesting.  When the first player selects a role, all other players may follow that role doing the exact same thing as the lead player.  For an example, if the lead player searches for more planets, they draw a card from the center and play as many cards with the search for planets symbol as they can from their hand to draw planets to settle/conquer.  All other plays may play as many cards with search for planets symbols from their hands to draw planets off turn.  After role selection, then the lead player discards as many cards as they want and draws up to five cards.  Play continues until one or two of the role card stacks is empty.  Player with the most points wins the galaxy.\\n\\nMechanics-As I mentioned above, this is a deck building game.  I like those games, but this one has the novel twist of letting all players do the same action as the lead player.  Now, if you're lucky/smart, you can take an action each turn instead of just waiting for your turn like in Dominion.  Also, the mechanics are very simple.  Play a card, draw a card and play cards that match symbols for more results, and discard/draw.  Easy as pie!  But, don't let the simplicity of this game make you think that the game doesn't have some depth to it. 5/5\\n\\nTheme-This game has a decent theme, but I don't think it oozes out of every pore.  The different ways to capture planets have diverse enough mechanics that you do feel you're doing something different when you do them. The art brings you into the game universe as you play cards.  However, the game doesn't really hammer you over the head with space conquest.  It's very subtle. 3.5/5\\n\\nInstructions-The games instructions are fairly well done, but an extra page or two would really help.  You can start playing this game in less than 10 minutes after opening the box for the first time without having played it before.  However, even I, an experienced player, still have to check board game geek if some things are allowed or intended.  The major issue has to do with symbols.  Advanced cards and planets have symbols on them.  Lots of people have questions if the advanced cards count as symbols for play.  Adding a discussion on that would have really knocked these instructions out of the park. 4.5/5\\n\\nExecution- This is well put together game.  The game has nice plastic ships!  In fact they are exactly the same ships as Eclipse.  They are as awesome here as they were there.  The box is nice, and the main play board is well done.  I like the art and card quality.  What I would like would be a bit larger play board with spaces for the advanced cards, the points, and the ships.  A little bit more would have really made this game excellent. 4.5/5\\n\\nSummary-This is an awesome game.  It's a quick deck building game that is easy to learn and play.  This game gives me a 4X feel without the 4X time or rules depth.  This game won't replace Twilight Imperium, but I promise you will play Eminent Domain far more often than that game!  This is another well done game from Tasty Minstrel Games.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.\\n\\nThis expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.\\n\\nTried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from \"analysis paralysis\" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.\\n\\nSome of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.\\n\\nIf you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.\\n\\nNitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!\\n\\nUPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>... not because it's not a great gateway game, but because there's an even better version out there.\\n\\nThe beauty of vanilla Ticket to Ride is its simplicity and accessibility for players of all ages and experience levels. Players can take one of three actions on a turn - take train cards (to build routes in the future), take destination tickets (to acquire new points scoring objectives), or claim routes by using the appropriate set of train cards (to score points and progress against objectives). The winner is the player that accumulates the most points for building routes and linking specific cities from their destination objectives. This simplicity allows the game to move at a very fast clip because players have usually chosen their action by the time their turns come around. However, this simplicity does not obviate the need for strategic play. Players will need to effectively balance long-term and short-term objectives, while keeping an eye on their opponents to stay one step ahead. The best part of Ticket to Ride is that you'll find yourself feeling like a powerful, cunning railroad magnate as you complete routes and destination tickets. In the end, it won't matter whether you win or lose because you'll have had an absolute blast.\\n\\nIt's little wonder that 'Ticket to Ride' is one of the most well-known and beloved gateway games. You can't go wrong by picking this one up, but I would highly recommend opting for 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' instead. The 'Europe' variant is superior in almost every way -- a better designed map and additional gameplay mechanisms that add strategic depth, mitigate randomness, and increase overall replayability and enjoyment.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Extremely elegant gameplay mechanics\\n+ Perfect for play with kids or inexperienced gamers\\n+ Players feel a sense of accomplishment even if they don't win\\n+ Moves at a fast clip; players quickly get into the groove of pre-planning their turn\\n+ Beautiful board game with high quality, colorful game components\\n+ Just enough decision making and trade-offs for a gateway game\\n\\nCons:\\n- 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' is superior in almost every way\\n- Train and railroad theme is not for everyone\\n- Location names can be difficult to read across the table\\n- Luck of the draw can make a very big impact in regards to destination tickets\\n- Very little player interaction\\n- Works ok with 2 players, but it's not as engaging</td>\n",



It is for 2-4 players.  In this game, players will be building an empire in space.  They will be surveying new planets to colonize or they can take them over through the use of warfare.  They will also be producing and trading goods while researching new technologies.  The player that gains the most influence for their empire will be declared the winner.\\n\\nTo begin, the board is placed on the table.  All the role cards are separated into stacks and placed on the board except for the Politics cards.  One of these is given to each player.  Players then receive a warfare and 2 of the following cards:  colonize, research, survey and produce/trade.  Players are randomly dealt a starting planet tile which is placed in front of them face down.  The remaining start planets are returned to the box.  The planet cards are shuffled and placed face down near the board.  Players are randomly dealt a player aid.  The player that receives the aid with the start player on the back of it becomes the first player.  The influence tokens are placed near the board, setting aside the 8 tokens that are different colored.  The technology cards are separated by type and sorted by cost before being placed face up in 3 different piles near the board.  Players now shuffle their starting cards and draw 5 from their deck.  Play now begins.\\n\\nOn a player's turn, they will each perform 3 phases; action phase, role phase and cleanup phase.  The first phase is the action phase.  This phase is optional and can be skipped if the player chooses to.  In this phase, the player may play a card from their hand and resolve it's action effect.  Survey cards allow you to draw 2 cards from your deck.  Warfare allows a player to either collect a fighter token or attack a planet by returning a number of fighter tokens and flipping over a planet in the player's empire.  Colonize cards allow a player to colonize by placing a the card under a planet in their empire or to settle a planet that has the correct amount of colonies already on the planet.  The produce/trade card allows a layer to either add a resource token to an empty slot on a planet or to return a resource for 1 influence token.  Research allows a player to remove 2 cards from their hand from the game.  This helps to thin down the player's deck.  Politics allows a player to trade it for a different role card.  The politics card is then removed from the game.  Some technologies also have actions which do different things, depending on the card.\\n\\nThe next phase is the role phase.  In this phase, the player leads one of their role cards by choosing a card from the board and playing it in front of them.  The card may then be boosted by adding additional cards from their hand with matching symbols.  The role effect is then resolved along with the leader bonus, taking into account the number of symbols used to boost the role.  The survey role allows a player to look at 1 fewer than the number of survey icons played and add it to their hand.  Leading allows them to look at 1 additional card.  The warfare role allows a player to collect fighters for each symbol used.  Leading allows the player to attack a planet instead of collecting fighters.  The colonize role allows a player to place 1 colony per icon under a planet in their empire.  Leading allows them to settle a planet with sufficient colonies under it instead.  The produce role allows a resource to be produced on empty slots for each icon while the trade role allows a resource to be traded for 1 influence for each icon.  Leading in either produce or trade allows no bonuses until the stack is depleted, then it adds 1 icon of the appropriate role.  The research role allows a player to take a technology card and add it to their empire, assuming they have the prerequisite planet(s) and enough research icons to pay for it.  Leading in research provides no bonus until the stack is depleted.  Like the produce/trade role it then gives an additional icon at that point.  When the player finishes with leading their role, the remaining players in turn order may either dissent or follow.  Dissenting allows them to draw an additional card from their deck.  Following allows them to play cards from their hand that match the symbol of the chosen role and perform the role effect without the leader bonus.\\n\\nThe final phase is the cleanup phase.  In this phase, the players discard any played cards and the active player may then discard any additional cards that they would like to.  They may then draw cards till their hand limit is reached.  Play then passes to the next player.\\n\\nThis all continues until either the influence supply or a number of role card stacks are depleted, depending on the number of players.  In a 2 or 3 player game it only takes 1 stack, while 3 and 4 player games require 2 stacks depleted.  Scoring then takes place.  Players add up their influence from any influence tokens gained and from face up planets in their empire as well as any technology cards with influence on them.  The player with the most points is the winner.\\n\\nCOMPONENTS\\nThis game has some really great components.  The board has clearly defined places for each stack of role cards much like Ascension's board does with it's cards.  The different role cards have bright colors and icons on them.  I almost wish that they would have had some different artwork along with the role icons but it makes sense with the game so I'm not complaining.  The planet cards are really cool looking.  They have that great space feel like something from Star Trek.  The starting planet cards are less like cards and more like thick tiles which makes them easy to pick out from the others.  The technology cards have some truly breathtaking artwork on them that I seriously love.  The resource tokens are all brightly colored for each of the different resources and are thick wood.  The influence tokens are thick cardboard and they look nice as well.  The player aids are thick cardboard like the start planet tiles.  I especially like that the start player is easily determined through handing out these tiles.  It's a very ingenious idea.  Of course the coolest part are the plastic fighter tokens.  They come in 3 sizes and each one is fantastically detailed.  I love just looking at them.  As I said, each piece is great and of very high quality.  This is one amazing looking game.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nRULEBOOK\\nThe rulebook for this game is very pretty to look at.  Each page is printed in glossy color.  There are tons of great pictures including how to set up the game.  Everything is easy to read and understand without any problems.  Each of the roles and actions are defined in great detail.  There is even a glossary of certain terms that are used in this game.  Also included are some game play variants which are for extended 3 player games and the learning game for new players.  I think that the best part though has to be the last page which shows a quick reference guide for all the technologies available in the game.  It really shows off the beauty of these cards.  I really love the look and feel of the book and find it to be as high quality as the components.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nThis  game is a load of fun.  It's pretty well known that I love a good deck building game and this one does not disappoint.  It's absolutely fantastic.  I really love how the theme really works in the game and makes it feel like you are building your own space empire either through colonization or warfare.  I really feel like a cross between a Starfleet Captain and the Empire as I either colonize or attack planets, adding them to my cause.  The technology cards really help to amp up your engine that you build through role selection.  Much like other deck builders, this game changes with your chosen cards through your particular play style.  The game is not that difficult and can be learned fairly easily.  Of course some of the terms might be a little confusing the first time so it's recommended to play the learning game.  We decided not to do that and jumped straight in to the full game.  I'm glad that we did as we really had no troubles at all.  My son loved the theme as did I and we both love the game play.  I mostly concentrated on warfare whereas he relied more on colonization.  After seeing me conquering planets left and right he began to turn his attention more to warfare as well.  Needless to say, this was the first stack to be extinguished.  The only complaint about gameplay that I could come up with was that every one of the players started with the exact same deck to begin with.  Of course this is fixed with the Escalation expansion that will be reviewed at a later time, so I won't really go into that here.  In any case, the game is truly amazing and we all love it.\\n9 out of 10\\n\\nOVERALL\\nEminent Domain is a light to medium weight deck building game full of strategy.  It can be played in about 45 minutes but will probably take over an hour for the first play through.  It did for us anyway.  The setup is quick and choosing first player is really simple through the use of the player aid tiles.  I love the artwork and find the theme is really integrated quite well.  It feels like you are creating your own space empire.  Everything from the cards to the plastic fighter tokens looks amazing, although I kind of wish that there had been more of that great artwork on the role cards instead of the large icons.  It's not that difficult and is fairly easy to learn.  Fans of deck building games like Ascension or card games like the Star Wars LCG should thoroughly enjoy this game.  I absolutely love it and find myself wanting to play it every opportunity that I can.  I highly recommend it.  It brings out my inner Starfleet Captain.  \"Space, the final frontier...\".\\n9 out of 10  \n",
       "3619   When I first heard about Days of Wonder's newest game, Ticket to Ride (Days of Wonder, 2004 - Alan Moon), I was excited. But how could I not be - for all of Days of Wonders games so far have been fabulous, and it seems that each successive game gets better and better. And Alan Moon with a train game (shades of Union Pacific) sounded like a winning combination. I had an opportunity to play the final version of the game, and was quite impressed with how the game looked.\\n\\nAnd is the game any good? The short answer is that once you play this game, you'll never play TransAmerica again. It's a fantastic medium-weight game - one that plays equally well with two to five players. The components are superb, the artwork is great, the game is downright fun (and nasty sometimes), and the total package is a very strong contender for the Spiel des Jahres 2004. (which it won!) After my first playing, I ranked it an 8; but after multiple playings the rating moved up to a 9, then a 9.5 - and if I keep playing the game at this rate - may move into my top ten list. Game play is very tight, and I found that game scores can run very close - making for an exciting game, all the way down to the finish.\\n\\nEach player receives forty-five train cars in one color, and places a matching round token of that color on a scoring track. A large board is placed in the middle of the table, with a map of America (circa late 1800's) superimposed upon it. Thirty-six cities are there, each connected by one or two \"railroad lines\". These lines are made up of one to six spaces, and are one of eight colors: purple, yellow, black, white, green, red, blue, brown, and gray (neutral color). A deck of \"tickets\" is shuffled, and three are dealt to each player. Players may discard one of them, but must keep at least two of them. Each ticket has two cities on them, and a point value that a player will receive if they connect those two cities, or lose if they don't connect the cities. The remainder of the ticket cards are shuffled and placed in a face down pile next to the board. A pile of train cards is shuffled, and four are dealt to each player. The remainder are shuffled and placed next to the board, then five of them are turned over and placed face-up next to the draw pile. The player who has traveled the most goes first, and then play continues clockwise around the table.\\n\\nOn a turn, a player may do one of three things. They may draw two cards, one at a time from either the face-up cards and/or the draw pile. Each card shows a different color of train car - matching the eight different colored spaces on the board. There is twelve of each color car in the deck. There are also eighteen \"locomotive\" cards, which function as wild cards. When a player draws a face-up card, the card is replaced immediately before they draw another card. A locomotive card counts as two cards if drawn when face-up, but only one if drawn when face-down. If there are ever three locomotive cards face-up at any time, all five cards are immediately discarded, and five new cards are drawn. If the cards run out, the discard pile is shuffled back to form a new draw deck.\\n\\nThe second thing a player may do is to draw three ticket cards. They must keep at least one of them, but have the option of keeping all of them, if they like. The others (if any), are discarded.\\n\\nThe third thing a player may do is play cards to place their train cars on the board. A player may play one through six cards of the same color (including wild cards), to place the same amount of train cards on a corresponding line on the board. For example, Las Vegas is connected to Salt Lake City by an orange line consisting of three spaces. Three orange cards must be played to put three trains of that player's color on those spaces. No more players could then place anything between those two cities, and if players want to connect those two cities with their lines, they'll have to go around the long way (if possible). Gray lines can have any color cards played to place trains on them, but the cards played must match the number of spaces in the gray line, and all of the cards must be the same color. When placing trains, the player doing so receives points - 1 point for one train placed, 2 points for two trains, 4 points for three trains, 7 points for four, 10 points for five, and 15 points for six trains. Some cities have two lines connecting them, both of which can be used in a four or five-player game. In a two or three-player game, however, once one of these lines has been used, the other cannot.\\n\\nWhen one player, after taking their turn, is down to two train cars or less, the final round begins. Starting with the player to their left, each player has one final turn, and then the game is over. The trains on the board are counted to make sure that the points were totaled correctly during the game, and then ticket cards are revealed. If players can trace a continuous path between the two cities on their card with their color train cars only, they receive the points, and move their tokens accordingly. Otherwise, they lose the points, and must move their token down the scoring track that many points. The player who has the longest continuous track also gets ten points. The player with the most points is the winner!\\n\\nSome comments on the game...\\n\\n1.) Components: As usual, the components for Ticket to Ride are supreme. Days of Wonder has, by far, more superior components for their games than any other company. The board is fantastic, with a nice map, and when the train cars - nice plastic cars in bright colors - are placed on it, the whole thing looks pretty fantastic! The cards are of the highest quality, and are about half the size of normal playing cards. Each color card not only has a different train car on it, but they have symbols in the corners to help differentiate between the colors (good for the color blind). Everything fits into a wonderful plastic insert that is in a beautiful, sturdy box - the same size as Days of Wonder's other Big Box Games.\\n\\n2.) Rules: The rules are only four pages - large, colorful, illustrated pages - but only four! The game is being printed in many languages - and has the distinction of being the first major game release that I know of that has been produced in Korea, something which is rather dear to my heart. The game can be explained in about 5 minutes, and I am very pleased at how easy it is for people to pick up. Even people who have a hard time understanding simple games (\"No, John, you cannot attack people in Settlers of Catan!\") had an easy time picking up the game - and I was amazed at how fast strategies were picked up.\\n\\n3.) Strategy: When I first was taught the game by Eric Hautemont, CEO of Days of Wonder, I didn't think that strategy would be that important. Then, he beat us, scoring 162 points to my 82, and my friends 54. I was floored! I thought that I was doing well, during the game, but realized several things that I missed afterwards. I found out in the game that there are different strategies, and was impressed with how they differed. One can ignore their ticket cards and just try to place long trains, hoping to get a lot of points. Or one can try to complete as many ticket cards as possible, not worrying too much about how long of trains they place on the board. Then, there is the middle ground - but is a compromise of the two strategies enough to win? Not to mention the fact that players must watch other players, and occasionally place trains to mess them up.\\n\\n4.) Cutthroat: This gives the game a real \"cut throat\" atmosphere. Sometimes the best move for a player is to place train cars between cities they don't care that much about - just to stop another player - either from getting the longest chain of cars, or completing their tickets. This can cause some enmity, but it's all in good fun, and I really enjoyed the player interaction - from taking cards to placing trains.\\n\\n5.) Holding cards: It's fun to get a big hand of cards (there is no upper limit). Players try to hoard cards so that they can place long trains of cars, scoring the big points. Also, players must always keep in mind that everyone else is watching them, trying to determine where they are going. The longer a player keeps the cards in their hand, the less they tip their hand. However, if one player suddenly uses up all their trains, causing the final round, and you are stuck with a huge hand of cards, it can be quite devastating. My wife found this out the hard way. She was about to connect three cities that would complete two of her tickets - probably winning the game. Another friend of mine, in the same game, had the same problem. Either one of them could have won the game, but because they held the cards just one turn to long - they lost. Of course, I was the evil guy who caused the game to end, but I got my just desserts, losing by only one point to yet another player - and the winning point was caused by her having the longest continuous train of cars.\\n\\n6.) Fun Factor: And yet, even with the bluffing, and the other little nasty tactics, the game is extremely fun. The decisions are short, causing the game to move quickly, but can be quite stressful at times. Yet these decisions really make the game fun! Blocking someone else off, using your own lines, pulling two locomotives from the draw pile, or finally connecting those two cities - all of this adds up to a wonderful time of fun!\\n\\n7.) Time and Players: The game runs quickly, because the decisions are important, but don't bog the game down to much. I was impressed with how well the game scaled, but found that the two-player game was much different than a five-player one. Both were fun, but needed different tactics.\\n\\nAs you can see, I really enjoyed this game. I think it has strong possibilities of being one of the best games of the year. Alan Moon has always been one of my favorite designers, and this is one of his best games in years. Days of Wonder has put a lot of time and effort into producing this game, and it shows. When I first played TransAmerica, I thought that it was a boring game -what was the point, and where was the strategy? Fortunately, the strategy and fun in this game are wonderful. I don't need a \"dumbed-down\" game to introduce new folks to the wonderful world of board games. I can just use games like this - tremendous, fun games, filled with tactical choices and enjoyable times.\\n\\nTom Vasel  \n",

Paid list value, but supporting local game stores helps keep them in business, and it's a rough market to keep a gaming store running. Also, I do not own, nor have I played&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dungeons-Dragons-Castle-Ravenloft-Board-Game/dp/0786955570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game</a>, the first D&D Adventures Board Game. Regardless...\\n\\nDungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game (WoA) is a fantastic value at $65 (list). You get 42 (plastic, unpainted) minis (1\" scale), you get a nice set of cardboard interlocking(!) dungeon tiles, and you get a fun, very random, board game playable either by yourself or with up to 4 friends.\\n\\nWhat it is:\\nWoA is, in gamer terms, a roguelike in tabletop form. In layman's terms, WoA is a dungeon crawler. You start at the entrance, and have a specific goal (rescue the villagers, survive the dungeon, destroy the altar, slay the dragon). The adventures are built randomly based on shuffling the tiles, and they are played individually as you explore. You can go for a massive linear dungeon based on a little luck and careful planning, or you can attempt to condense yourself in a larger swarm interconnected tunnels.\\n\\nSome of the adventures feature \"chambers\", special larger rooms that are all placed at once and filled with enemies and a specific goal that the team must complete to win the adventure.\\n\\nIt's a great way to introduce someone into tabletop roleplaying gaming, it's the perfect medium between a board game and an actual pen and paper RPG.\\n\\nIt's a fun, quick* game to run a quick adventure for some friends taking anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour per adventure.\\n\\nWhat it isn't:\\nA deeper roleplaying game with a full interconnected series of quests over a grand campaign.\\n\\nA completely accurate representation of 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons rules.\\n\\nOverly complicated (as most roleplaying games will seem to be for most people.)\\n\\nWhat's in the box:\\n* 42 plastic heroes and monsters\\n* 13 sheets of interlocking cardstock dungeon tiles\\n* 200 encounter and treasure cards\\n* Rulebook\\n* Scenario book\\n* 20-sided die\\n\\nMiniatures:\\nThe game includes 42 minis, including 7 villan, 5 hero, and 30 monsters. The minis are of nice quality. They're clearly just mass produced, but they put some effort into modeling them, just not so much into trimming the leftover plastic in places. Some of the swords will be bent from being in the box. And they're unpainted. However, I don't mind the unpainted state, and I plan on using them during D&D Encounters I'm DMing at a local store. The Ashardalon figurine is very detailed, my *only* (and the only real) gripe is that none of them are painted.\\n4/5\\nCardstock Dungeon Tiles:\\nThey're one of the nicest parts of the set. They're very high quality, the art is nice, and the interlocking design can't be beat. Purchasers of D&D Dungeon Tiles will know how hard they are to keep together without tape, these lock together like puzzle pieces. Wouldn't be hard to use them in a real D&D game, except for the fact that they're somewhat limited, and they're not large open spaces. There are a lot of tokens and HP markers and other things all made out of the same cardstock (including cards for the Villans, your big bad guys, and the Heroes)\\n5/5\\n200 Encounter, Monster & Treasure cards\\nThese are drawn during the different phases of the game (there are 3), and they certainly add to the randomness of the game. Everything scales nicely so that you can attempt to run the party adventures solo and it'll still work nicely.\\n5/5\\nRulebook:\\nThe rulebook is the only real downfall I've seen of the box set. It does an alright job at conveying the basics, but other questions I have are just non-existant. Can I spend a healing surge without being dead just to heal? The book itself has card errata on the back page, which is crazy. Other than that, it's not a bad rulebook for being only 15 pages.\\n3.5/5\\nScenario Book (\"Adventure Book\")\\nThis has 13 adventures to run using the set, each of them varying based on how things shuffled, what magic items get drawn and if there's a chamber, what chamber card gets drawn. The adventures essentially play themselves as you follow the turn orders. There's very little fluff for each of the adventures, but that's what make it D&D, you get to set your own motivation for the adventure, your own background. It's enough to get you going, and you let your imagination take it from there.\\n4.5/5\\n20 sided die\\nAKA, the d20. THE iconic D&D symbol. You roll it, add a modifier and compare it to a set number. That's pretty much it. It's just as nice as the D&D Red Box dice or any chessex dice I've bought. But it's just a d20, nothing special. Nice if you don't have any, throw it in the bag with all your others.\\n5/5\\n\\nOverall, I would have liked to see more adventures (that's not to say more aren't coming, the official ones available at time of review require Castle Ravenloft as well, which I don't have yet.) There's only one \"solo\" adventure, but I played through it and adventure 5 solo. Not sure if a single player could take on Ashardalon himself, but half the fun is seeing how well you can do.\\n\\nI actually wouldn't mind running a full D&D campaign with similar designs; it's a perfect format for a Megadungeon delve, it's fast, and it's exciting due to the randomness. I'm glad the cards aren't collectable, there's 200, that's all there is.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're into RPGs, or if you've ever wondered if a Roguelike could work in a tabletop format, it can, and it's called Wrath of Ashardalon.\\n\\n*Edit* I forgot to mention, the initial setup (punching out the cards) takes a considerable amount of time. Like close to 20 minutes. Setup per adventure doesn't take nearly as long (maybe 2-3 minutes)  \n",

                                                                                                                                                           The USA version of Ticket To Ride is fun but frustratingly cutthroat; I would not recommend getting the base set without the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1910-Expansion/dp/B000K8FYAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1910 Expansion</a>, which offers three superior variants, more tickets (routes) and regular sized playing cards to replace the tiny ones included in the base set. The main problem with the base set is that whoever builds the big northern routes usually wins, exacerbated by the awarding of a \"longest route\" ticket worth bonus points. The 1910 expansion offers you the choice of eliminating the longest route bonus and awarding a \"most routes completed\" bonus instead, or using both of them, or neither. That helps tailor the win condition to best suit the group.\\n\\nHowever, I still prefer the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ticket-to-Ride-Europe/dp/B000809OAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ticket to Ride Europe</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-1912-Expansion/dp/B002OFLL7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride 1912 Expansion</a>&nbsp;because of it provides more interesting challenges (ferries and tunnels) and adds stations players can use to get around being cut off in completing their routes. These stations can easily be used in USA or other versions. Europe still has the \"longest route\" bonus points award but this is easier to get for everyone because if you have to use a station to complete a route ticket, it no longer counts toward your getting the longest route award.\\n\\nAnother excellent option over the USA version is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-To-Ride-Marklin/dp/B000EYF7RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Days of Wonder Ticket To Ride - Marklin</a>&nbsp;(Germany) version that adds passengers you can use to score crazy bonus points that add a whole new strategy to the game; unlike the stations in Europe, however, the passenger mechanic is not easily integrated into other editions. Another nice thing about Marklin is that it offers the most balanced map with a near equal distribution of long and short routes which are split up on the left and right sides of the vertical map. With Marklin, completing a ton of short routes is just as viable a win strategy as long routes in the USA base sets.\\n\\nBoth Europe and Marklin also split your initial ticket allotment into long (blue-backed) and short (brown-backed) routes; you get to choose how many of each you want to do--unlike the USA base set, which is totally random in its ticket distribution (long routes are harder to complete but offer more bonus points to win than short routes).\\n\\nI also enjoy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ticket-to-Ride-Switzerland-Map-Expansion/dp/B000WTDUZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ticket to Ride Switzerland Map Expansion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Days-of-Wonder-Ticket-to-Ride-Nordic-Countries-Board-Game/dp/B001E9641K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Days of Wonder Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries Board Game</a>. Both Switzerland and Nordic Countries are designed for only 2-3 players, unlike the usual 2-5) so they are great options for smaller groups. They also offer the two most challenging maps.  Unfortunately, Switzerland is out-of-print and online sellers are charging a fortune for it.  You can play it and the USA and Europe versions online, however, for a much more reasonable cost (live opponents or vs. the computer).  I've played the online version almost 1,000 times since August 2010 but I still love playing the board games.  They are my favorite board games of all time!\\n\\nOne thing to watch out for, in my opinion, is that the original USA edition is initially fun but that fun can turn to frustration once you realize the easiest way to win is to just build the long northern routes. That problem is corrected with the 1910 Expansion by providing new route tickets, a new way to score bonus points, and two variants: Big Cities and USA Mega-Game -- the Mega-Game uses everything in the expansion set and is my favorite way to play Ticket To Ride: USA). However, I still prefer the maps and additional challenges (like building ferries and tunnels) that are provided by the Europe and Marklin editions.\\n\\nNo matter which version you pick, if you know how to play one, the others are easy to pick up, and the rules of all editions are fast and easy to learn in about 5 minutes.\\n\\nTicket To Ride is, in my opinion, the best light strategy (or \"gateway\") game on the market to bring family and friends together.  Actual game time may vary depending on the number of players, their familiarity with the maps and rules, and how quickly they can strategize and complete their turn (most turns are finished in a minute or less but some could last up to 5, especially when choosing additional route tickets). I'd say every version of Ticket To Ride (even with expansions) takes about 60 minutes on average but a game could last anywhere from 30-120 minutes (the difference between having 2 players vs. 4-5, for example, and/or if some newbie players need rules or strategy help, or are just really bad at making decisions and revising their strategy on the fly).  \n",

I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.\\n\\nAcquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes\\n\\n*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.\\n\\nAcquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.\\n\\nVersion & Components\\n\\nThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.\\n\\nI need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.\\n\\nSome people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.\\n\\nPrevious versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.\\n\\nGame Mechanics\\n\\nThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.\\n\\nIn Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.\\n\\nWhen a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.\\n\\nPlayers continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.\\n\\n1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"\\n\\n2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.\\n\\n3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.\\n\\n- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.\\n\\n- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.\\n\\n- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.\\n\\nThe acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.\\n\\nAt the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.\\n\\nThe Review\\n\\nAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.\\n\\nI focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.\\n\\nIt seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.\\n\\nThe kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.\\n\\nI personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.  \n",

The occasional breeze made so many stacks of card perilous, but it would have been too warm in the tent.  I was enthralled: surveying planets that would be subdued either by force of amassed fleets of fighters or more subtle attrition with one colony at a time.  I was producing and trading resources for points, and researching new technologies that- as I think of it- seldom improved the quality of life for my empire- some of the most expensive ones are game changes though all this from the comfort of a picnic bench.\\n\\nGame Play\\n\\nThis is a role-based game similar to Puerto Rico.  Where one player chooses a role and does the action then others get to do it too, though not with the same bonus as the person who chose the role.  Its also a deck building game like Dominion only the number of cards to choose from is always the same and is much smaller.  This leads to how the role portion is different.  The more often you choose a role, the stronger you will likely be when you choose that role again in the future.\\n\\n My Canadian friends might at the point say, Eh?  (read: Please explain or huh?) Lets take surveying planets: before you can grow your empire youve got to find planets in the vastness of space.  The way its handled is you draw as many cards from the planet deck as one less than the number of survey cards in your hand.  Got three?  You draw 2 planets.  Look em over, consider and weigh them and then pick the won you want to show up in your empire.  Letss say you chose the role of survey, well you get to add a survey card to your hand, now you have four! You can pick and choose from more planets now, leading to better planet discoveries.  The poor guys who don't have at least two survey cards in their hand can abstain and draw a card from their deck to help them for the next role selection.\\n\\nThe roles are:\\n\\n*Survey  Described above\\n\\n*Colonize  One method of making a survey planet one of yours for points, trading opportunities, or other bonuses.\\n\\n*Warfare  Second method surveyed planets become yours\\n\\n*Produce/Trade  How you make or sell goods for points\\n\\n*Research  Buy cards to add to your hand that help in role phase for either of two roles\\n\\nPrior to choosing a role, you have an action phase.  This is when you can actually subdue planets.  Or use a research card to trash cards from your deck so they won't come up again.  Used in the action phase, the survey card will let you draw two new cards.\\n\\nThere are a few end conditions.  You run out of point tokens, or two piles of role cards are depleted.  There is a last up opportunity till you get back to the start player.  So everyone gets the same number of turns- even extra victory tokens (different color) that can be earned during those turns.\\n\\nAs I said, points can be earned by selling goods and by subduing planets, but also by possessing of some research cards.  Whoever has the most at the end wins.\\n\\n I hate to tell you what to do but\\n\\nMultiple paths to victory is the name of the game.  Ive won going heavy on subduing planets, pushing an early game end producing and trading goods like crazy once I had four or five planets.\\n\\nSomething to watch out for when colonizing a planet, don't embark on one that you don't have enough colonize cards for.  These cards get tied up with the planet card and you need on in your hand during the action phase to finally flip the planet over.  If they are all tied up there, youll never be able to seal the deal.  (ok, you can buy a research card, and wait for it to be shuffled into the deck and finally be picked up.) or you could just watch out for that sort of thing.  The warfare method doesnt tie up cards- being a bit safer.\\n\\n Theme\\n\\nPerhaps its apparent that I get caught up in the game.  The little fighters are awesome and sometimes get flown from where they were amassed to the planet they are subduing before they get returned to the supply because, by gum, Im in space!  Theres never any battle, just a threshold that needs to be met to subdue.  The planets are pretty the cards are gorgeous.  The resource chips, though variously colored to represent different resources aren't limiting if someone is hoarding them, but they are kind of plain.  I suppose you might take this out of space and then you are looking for islands to conquer instead?  Man-o-wars are probably more expensive to make than the little fighters.\\n\\n Balance\\n\\nMost games have felt pretty close that Ive played.  You may look over at someones empire and see they have many more planets than you but hopefully you are thinking, yeah, but my stack of tokens from trade is a lot bigger than his while the third guy is smiling about the points from the technology cards.  If you are woeful, and you might be your first time, then if the shoe fits\\n\\n Interaction\\n\\nThis game encourages interaction.  Youve got to tell people what role you are doing so they can do it too.  But after that, my empire might as well be in a parallel universe.  I cant survey your planets.  I cant send my ships to your planet to steal your or destroy your goods, let alone take your planet and pleasantly trade with you.  That would be a fantastic expansion, says I.\\n\\n Learning Curve\\n\\nMedium.  At least when Ive taught people the idea of tapping a card to affect the roll before or after it happens seems to be a sticking point, mostly because there are only two kinds of cards that go before a roll and you are used to tapping all the rest of the cards after you roll.  Once you get past that, then theres the analysis paralysis for those who struggle with the idea of multiple routes to victory.  Which of all those cards should I try to get?  Happily the opening options are limited.  The options increase as people warm up to the game- hopefully getting the hang of it.\\n\\n Downtime\\n\\nNot much at all.  You are either getting a new card or doing a role.  Sometimes it takes a while for them to choose their action and unless they announce what role they are doing you could see them doing an action and jump the gun.  But\\n\\n Whats not to Like?\\n\\nThe prude in me strikes again: My permanent marker helped me a bit with the Artificial Intelligence card.  Really?  I grinning guy looking forward to time with a metal-clad winking female shaped robot?  Except the forced interaction previously described, its even more solitaire-like than Puerto Rico.  At least there you can shaft people by claiming a boat or two and cause them to throw their goods in the drink or buy the building you know the other guy needs or sell the good to the trader they have so they cant.  Yes, thats how I play that game.  I like to think of it as defensive playing.  Yeah, thats it.  But no room for that in this game.  I guess my mom should really like it.  I guess there could be a race for the really cool tech cards but thats pretty weak.\\n\\n Adaptations\\n\\nDont let the wee ones touch it- ok, theyve played with the fighters and the 1/8 thick planet cards.  Ive bought two copies of the game so that up to 8 can play.  And I think- for an expansion that you should be able to scout neighbors planets and trade with them and attack them.  Add a card called planetary defense that lets you beef up defenses on a planet.  If you trade with a surveyed planet you get two points and put the good on their planet and they can sell it.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If you only employ one creativity-enhancing resource for the rest of your life, make that resource the Ball of Whacks!\\n\\nBreakthroughs in effective creativity-inspiring methods seldom occur.  Most \"new\" methods are simply restatements or reshapings of ideas that flourished among the ancient Greeks (such as Heraclitus, a favorite source for Mr. von Oech) or before.  Those who are familiar with the earlier work usually don't gain much from the newer approaches.  The Ball of Whacks is a happy exception.  Heraclitus would say that you can never interact with the Ball of Whacks twice in the same way.  And he would be right.\\n\\nThe most valuable creativity-enhancing methods I've experienced usually require having a team work together, with one of the tasks involving making little models or prototypes of creative concepts.  I often find myself wishing I could have those experiences more often . . . but seldom having the right people and time to pursue that desire.\\n\\nThen, I discovered Roger von Oech's Ball of Whacks. Wow!\\n\\nMy frustrations are now behind me.\\n\\nThis is day 8 of working with the Ball of Whacks.  It's been quite an education.  I can hardly wait to find out what I'll learn on day 9!\\n\\nWhen you first see the Ball of Whacks, you won't quite know what to make of it.  Open the box, take out the ball, the magnetic stand and the workbook.\\n\\nThen, let yourself go.  Discover what the ball is.  To the geometrically inclined, you'll notice that it's a rhombic triacontahedron (try saying that 5 times fast!), a ball-like shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  The ball feels somewhat alive, however.  It gives when you squeeze it and resumes it shape when you stop squeezing it.  As soon as you take out a piece, you'll discover that the ball is composed of 30 design blocks that use magnetism to adhere to one another.\\n\\nAs you take the pieces apart, the ball disappears and many regular and irregular shapes occur. Usually, that's the end for me.  I can never recover the original shape (my Rubik's cube is still a mess!), but the ball is easy to reform (if I can do it, you can too).\\n\\nI like abstract shapes and I was pleased to find that the magnets act both to attract and repel the pieces. Unlike Lego pieces, connections can be made in all kinds of odd ways.  I also noticed that the pieces often reshape themselves, almost organically, as they choose a different connection than the one that I initiated. The casual results are often better than my planned ones.\\n\\nBased on a suggestion in the workbook, I began mixing in other objects that could be held by the design blocks.  The results were infinitely more interesting and rewarding than anything I'd ever created before.  I felt a great sense of peace from the experience.  Many people had told me I would like sculpting, but I lacked the confidence to try.  With the Ball of Whacks, I felt like a super sculptor . . . but without any lessons.\\n\\nAfter several days of working on abstract shapes, I decided to try geometric shapes.  These were paradoxically harder to do in many cases.  The magnetism sometimes fought me.  I had to design clever solutions to create the regularity I wanted to see.\\n\\nI also left the Ball of Whacks out to see what others would say.  Everyone noticed that I kept changing it.  Without thinking, rewarding new designs would emerge in a few seconds.  I gained confidence in my creativity involving forms.\\n\\nAt the same time, I was working on a number of non-physical problems.  Soon, I began seeing metaphors in the blocks and my designs for those problems.  New and better solutions began to flood my mind.\\n\\nFeeling like I should read more of the workbook, I now found myself intrigued by the directions for how to use the Ball of Whacks to expand my creative repertoire.  I began to see huge gaps between the methods I prefer to use, gaps that I could easily explore and understand with my new appreciation of my creativity habits.\\n\\nBest of all, the lessons are deeply ingrained.  The human nervous system is mostly made up of connections between the hands and eyes to and from the brain.  By both holding and seeing what I was working on, the exercise connects more parts of my brain and experience.  I find totally different memories being stimulated, especially those from the sandbox and while playing with modular toys.\\n\\nToday, I went back and totally redid a book proposal I'm working on.  I was astonished to see that my mind was connecting those little blocks from The Ball of Whacks into new ways of assembling the pieces of the proposal.  I would never have expected that.\\n\\nWhat does the name mean?  I don't think there's just one meaning.  It obviously sounds like \"ball of wax\" which is something that warms and becomes malleable in our hands.  I'm reminded of the red wax that you peel off of Edam cheese to form shapes.  At another level, a \"whack\" in von Oech's vocabulary is a way of getting you to let go of artificial assumptions.  In that sense, this is a tool to give you lots of whacks.  And it does.\\n\\nI haven't done all of the exercises yet, but I plan to.  Each of the ones I've done has been quite an eye-opener.\\n\\nHere's a tip.  Turn off the TIVO while you're watching television and use the commercial breaks to play with the Ball.  The baseball playoffs are excellent for this purpose because you get all kinds of short delays.\\n\\nBe smart.  Give a Ball of Whacks to each of your children rather than purchasing another toy.  You'll inspire genius that will constantly fascinate you.  \n",

When you open the lid, you'll see that it's covered in gorgeous artwork depicting battles between the United Earth Defense Force and the Zentraedi Armada.\\n\\nThen you'll look inside the box, and you'll notice how much stuff is inside.  There's over 20 plastic sprues, which will allow you to assemble 5 Veritech Fighters, 5 Guardians, 6 Battloids (1 extra, I guess in case you screw up), 2 Tomahawks, 2 Defenders, 12 Battlepods, 1 Glaug, 1 Quel-Regult, and 1 Quel-Gulnau, which I didn't recognize from the series but is apparently a Zentraedi \"Recovery Pod.\"  There's also over 50 stat cards (they are sort of laminated, but I wouldn't risk writing directly on them), 24 Robotech-themed 6-sided dice (12 UEDF, 12 Zentraedi), 20 infuriatingly small command tokens, a blue artiller template, 2 decal sheets that will give you flashbacks to your childhood, and 1 decent-sized, full-color rulebook.  There's almost TOO MUCH stuff.\\n\\nUnlike Warhammer 40,000 or Warmachine's \"starter board games\", there's enough in this box that you'd never need to buy anything else (I'm sure you'd need two or three boxes if you wanted to play in a Robotech RPG Tactics tournament, but as I mention below, this isn't really a \"tournament\" game).  Of course, there's a flyer in the box that advertises all of the cool stuff you COULD buy - it seems there are plans to release some of the more obscure Macross saga mecha, followed by the Masters Saga and New Generations machines at some future point - but the rulebook is full of plenty of scenarios you can play using just this box set.  You're also not going to want to buy anything else after getting this box, at least for a little while.  This thing takes forever to put together.\\n\\n2) PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER\\n\\nLet's not beat around the bush: the average number of pieces you'll need to assemble one if these playing pieces is TWENTY.  \"Big deal\", you say, \"I can put together Space Marines in my sleep.\"  Not so fast, these are much more similar to Japanese Gundam models than typical gaming miniatures.  You're going to be using an X-acto blade to cut these brittle plastic pieces (think the material used to make Lego bricks, but thinner) from their sprues, filing down seams, filling in gaps, and praying to God you don't glue your fingers together.  Getting this game ready to play will take more than a couple hours.  We're talking at least a holiday weekend... longer if you plan on doing the kinds of customization that will make this product look truly exceptional.\\n\\nIf you consider yourself an \"expert\" at assembling tiny plastic model kits, this product will challenge you to create some of the most beautiful figurines you can imagine.  Give yourself three hours to cut and reposition limbs, and you'll be able to recreate any pose the Valkyries take in the show.  If you have a pin vise and a can of GluBoost sitting in front of you right now, and you love Robotech, then go ahead and add this product to your shopping cart, because Robotech RPG Tactics is your playground.\\n\\nHowever, if you consider yourself a \"beginner\" or even \"intermediate\" hobbyist, then these models are going to frustrate you.  Whoever designed this product made several legitimately horrible design choices: they gave the models amazing potential at the expense of accessibility.  In fact, if you've never used model clippers and superglue to put together a model kit, I would suggest you stay far, far away from Robotech RPG Tactics, because you'll end up with a bad impression of the hobby.\\n\\n3) PLAYING THE GAME\\n\\nAfter playing the story-based missions from the rulebook, I think this game does a great job simulating the \"feeling\" of Robotech/Macross.  The Valkyries dart around the battlefield, switching forms in response to the flow of battle.  You'll immediately notice how different a Valkyrie operates in each of its three modes, and each mode offers its own distinct advantages and disadvantages (it's not quite so simple as \"fighters can move the greatest distance\"; they actually HAVE to maintain forward thrust every turn, they follow strict turning requirements, etc.).  Regults play like expendable footsoldiers - they have a rule called \"life is cheap\", and Khyron can gain temporary bonuses by killing his own men - while Glaugs provide their squads with an increased range of command options.  There are special things Valkyries can do when they are \"in formation\", but they can also split up and try to flank the enemy forces.  On any given turn, Rick will fire missiles at a squadron of Regults, the Regults will try to shoot them down, the surviving Regults will shoot back at Rick... and then you can choose whether Rick dodges, attempts to \"roll with it\", or Ben dives in front of Rick and takes a bullet for him.  Each turn, both players are given a set number of \"command points\", which can be used to accomplish feats of improbable heroism or villainy.\\n\\nOverall, the rules provide an extremely cinematic game experience.  At times, you'll feel like you lost because your opponent outplayed you; at other times, you'll feel like you only won because of dumb luck.  You'll rarely feel like the rules are unfair; however, you'll often feel like the rules are fun at the expense of clarity.  For instance, in tournament miniature wargames such as Warmachine, the rules clearly delineate when you can measure the distance between two models, and when you can't.  In Robotech RPG Tactics, you're allowed to measure whenever you want, but the rulebook gives a friendly reminder that, sometimes, frequent measuring and re-measuring can bog down the game's pace.  Although this kind of thing didn't seem like a serious problem to me or anyone I played Robotech RPG Tactics with, I know from past experiences that many miniatures wargamers, especially those who like to play in tournaments, want rulebooks to be as specific as possible.  For those kinds of wargamers, Robotech RPG Tactics may seem unpolished.\\n\\n4) FINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nRobotech RPG Tactics was produced by the role-playing game company Palladium (famous for games like \"Rifts\", which emphasize tone over mechanics) and the young-and-hungry miniatures designers Ninja Division (famous for producing a number of anime-themed, \"you either love it or you hate it\" games such as \"Relic Knights\" and \"Tentacle Bento\").  Perhaps this is why the components Ninja Division produced - the miniatures - are best enjoyed by experienced hobbyists looking for a challenge, while the components Palladium produced - the rulebook, the stat cards, etc. - are best enjoyed by Robotech fans who have been waiting years to play a Robotech board game, but may not have much experience with Robotech RPG Tactics' competitors such as Battletech or Heavy Gear.  I think that if you are interested in Robotech or robot model kits enough to consider buying this product, you should go for it.  Even if there are parts of Robotech RPG Tactics you feel could have been done better, you'll feel like you got enough Robotech merchandise to justify the price tag.  \n",

                                                                                                The game is easy to learn and explain. One person draws a card and selects a question from it to read out loud. Everyone else writes down an answer that they think the reader will think is the best answer. All of the answers are played face up, and the reader secretly selects the one they like best. The other players now try to guess which one the reader picked. Players score points for writing the winning answer, voting on the winning answer, and the reader gets points for people guessing right. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Apples to Apples (the playing and picking answers), Wits and Wagers Family (the betting aspect), and any one of a number of party games that rewards you for knowing the other players well or provides an opportunity to get to know each other better. While that may sound like a bit of a mash-up, it plays very smooth and really hit the sweet spot for us.\\n\\nThis game is about the experience, but here's a few quick thoughts about the rules/components/etc. I appreciate that this game is easy to teach, and that you really can just jump right in and play. No one seems to have any questions, it's nice when the rules just blend into the background and the focus is on fun. I really like that each card has three possible questions and the reader gets to choose which one to pick. Aside from increasing replayability, this is an opportunity to direct the game a bit, avoid something you don't want to talk about, or explore what the other players might think you think on a fun topic.  This is the type of game you could really play for any length of time, but the scoring system seems to have the game play out for just the right amount of time. I did miss the meeples though! We love betting with the meeples in Wits & Wagers Family, and with the art of the game showing meeple images I found myself looking through the box a couple times to try to find them. There are tokens that are used instead, but I like the meeples better and wish they had been included in this game as well.\\n\\nWits and Wagers Family was a big hit with my extended family over the holidays, so I was really excited to give Say Anything Family a try at a recent family get together. I was able to easily convince my mom and grandma, my aunt Judy, and my uncle Rob to give it a try. This game had us laughing, groaning, telling stories, and having fun together right from the get go. We were grossed out by the idea of kissing a urinal, imagining what the best part of being a dog is, pondering how lottery winnings would be spent, discussing who would be the most fun to have dinner with (Gene Simmons in full costume?!!?), and laughing about what the weirdest family secret might be. We kept a causal pace throughout the game, with lots of conversation and smiles. It really was an amazing experience, and I'm looking forward to many more plays. It was a big hit, and we ended up with a phenomenal 12 thumbs up, everyone loved it!\\n\\nRandy\\nGrowing Up Gamers  \n",

You just cut me off, now instead of destination cards giving me gobs of points, now they all count against me.  Theres no way around!  My nerves have never felt more vexed than they do now.  Thats Jane Austin speak for: Im seeing red and now Im going to do anything I think might hurt your chances for the rest of the game; and the next one we play!\\n\\n Ok, so the first time this happens, theres usually another way around, its probably the long way around, but hopefully you have enough trains to make it, because thats a constraint you have to work under.\\n\\n Game Play\\n\\nThis handsomely illustrated elongated board looks has a map of the United States dotted with notable cities that are connected by short and long lines of rectangles (or tracks).  In line of track is one of several colors.\\n\\n You start the game with some cards in your hand that are nicely illustrated train cars of the same several colors.  Each turn you either\\n\\n  take you can draw two cards from either some face up cards or roll the dice and choose some from a facedown draw pile, or a combination.  If you pick a wild from the face-up pile, you only get one card that turn.\\n\\n  buy a route (lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities)  You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains.\\n\\n  Draw three Destination Cards.  Youve got to keep at least one.  These give a method to the madness of which routes you buy.\\n\\nAs you lay down your trains you rack up points, The longer the track, the larger the gain.  If you successfully complete the route on your destination card, you also rack up points, but those you conceal till the end of the game.\\n\\n The game ends a full round after someone has fewer than four trains- everyone but the catalyst gets another turn.\\n\\n Points are scored as Ive said, but those destinations you weren't able to complete, yeah those count as negative points.  Oooo.. ouch.\\n\\n I hate to tell you what to do but\\n\\nKeep an eye on how many trains your opponents have left, don't be stupid and fill your hand with destinations when you won't have time to complete them.\\n\\n If it looks like a route you need is one that your opponent might need, you have a vested interest in getting there first, even if its an easy one.\\n\\n You may even consider drawing more destination cards for your first turn or two so that you can spend more time in the game working on more that are related. Than getting those you start with and drawing more in the middle of the game.\\n\\n What does related mean?  Consider the following routes:\\n\\nLA to Miami (goes from the south-east corner of the US to the south-west corner)\\n\\nNew Orleans to Duluth (goes north and south through the center of the US)\\n\\nSalt Lake City to Houston (goes from the western US to the south-center)\\n\\n Because there could easily be much overlap in the first and third route, but not the second route, Id dump the second route and keep the other two.\\n\\n Theme\\n\\nWell, several off-shoots from Ticket to Ride have come.  Not to mention an expansions for the original game that adds several smaller routes.  So there is evidence that the theme can be slanted, but in Ticket To Ride Europe, game play is the same with some twists, like you can use someone elses route for your destinations sake without getting points for the route, and you route requiring tunneling through mountains are more pricey.  These off-shoot stand alone games are a good way for Days of Wonder to charge full price for what could have been a less expensive expansion to the existing game.\\n\\n I can hear you say, Yeah, but they are boards in different venues!\\n\\n Yes, they are, but Rio Grande seemed to be able to offer double-sided boards (Yes, that means two new maps) and new rule sets for Power Grid for less than half the cost of the original game.\\n\\n Oh...  Really?\\n\\n Yup.  But for comments to the theme itself, I think the original game is pretty strong.  Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking, especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection.  Ive got lots of little trains!  Cool little plastic trains!\\n\\n Balance\\n\\nWhile I often complain about chance and this game includes card, the fact that you don't have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it, and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps.  Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with.  Tit for tat.  Anyway, for having cards, I have no complaints.\\n\\n Interaction\\n\\nInteraction is low.  While verbal congrats are possible, expressions of dismay and indifference often follow someone laying track.  If you cant reach the cards, there will be- give me those two oranges or, how about two off the mystery pile of joy!  But as I think of it, this game could be played in silence.  So if you are entertaining that favorite group of mine to pick on- introverts, you already knew what you were in for.\\n\\n Learning Curve\\n\\nLow.  The purchase price card you get tells you how much things cost and the production of a square base on die roll and Robber operation are pretty easy.  Each development cards has what it does written plainly on it.  While the rules are easy, the options are pretty limited and objective is pretty straightforward.\\n\\n Downtime\\n\\nNominal.  While you do have to wait your turn, there is a possibility that the track you want to buy gets bought on someone elses turn.  If you pay attention you can make groans at the time they will pay off the most.\\n\\n Whats not to Like?\\n\\nI cant think of anything bad to say that I haven't already said.  Its a great game that has done much good for the industry and I trust the makers are raking in mega bucks with all their spin offs.  If people are willing to pay, they deserve it.  Ah, the beauty of capitalism.  I guess there are eccentric people out there, who are happy to shell out another $35 to $50.\\n\\n Collateral Endorsement\\n\\nI haven't come across a soul who didn't like this game, but you may say that my social circles are small.  You are probably right, but I love growing them with games.  My kids love to line up the trains from here to there, but they have severed my board in one place, so beware, the (read: any) board is best set up on a table rather than the carpet floor where wee feet are won't to walk.  \n",

6.5, and I still think this is one of the best things I've bought on Amazon.  We recently saw one of those horrible ASPCA commercials, and she asked if we could send money to the \"dogs in cages.\"  She's got the money, so she gets to make those choices.  I love that about this system.  She has donated money to the WWF twice.  If I were to do it all over again, I think I would just commit to $3 per week ($1 per container) - I didn't think that would add up fast enough, but $2 per week has added up way faster than it needs to, and so she doesn't fully understand scarcity.  Even so, she has a much better understanding of money than she would otherwise, and basically has for as long as she can remember because we started this when she was just 4.  Her little sister is 2.5, I'll be buying another one of these when the younger one turns 4.  I don't think there's anything special about the bank itself (by the way, it has held up perfectly - I was afraid the rubber band would lose its elasticity over time, but it still holds the pieces together strongly), but the system is solid, and one of the aspects of parenting that I actually feel like I'm doing right.\\n\\n---\\n\\nNew update:  It's been a year, my daughter is about to turn 5, and I'm still really excited about this bank.  We took her \"share\" money and looked at charities online.  She chose to give to the Word Wildlife Fund, which has a cool thing where if you donate a certain amount of money, they'll send you a stuffed animal of the animal that you choose to sponsor.  She's definitely still no expert of money, but she's doing really well for her age, and understands when I say things like \"we can't afford this,\" or \"let's save up money for that.\"  Great, great purchase.\\n\\n---\\nUpdate:  We've now had this about 5 months.  She has used her \"spending\" money to buy stuffed animals at the zoo (which are super overpriced - but now I don't worry about it, that's for her to figure out!), and we opened up a bank account with her \"save\" money.  I honestly am so glad we are doing this.  She has a much, much better grasp of money, and what it means to spend it or save it.  We are going to do the \"share\" portion close to the holidays, when I will let her choose a charity.  She already is looking forward to that - I don't know how much she understands yet, since we haven't done it, but she will.  But in the past several months, watching the money grow, opening a bank account, using her \"spending\" money - this has been a really, really fantastic item.\\n\\n---\\nI have been wanting to start to get my daughter to think about money, and saving it for what she wants.  I didn't know if 4 was too young (she just turned 4), but she understood immediately that she needs to start holding onto money so that she can buy a stuffed animal flamingo at the zoo.  Additionally, she is super motivated now to do things for money.  I debated whether or not I wanted to have this be a part of our routine - money as a reward, learning how to save/spend/etc. so early - but it has been fantastic.  She doesn't quite grasp the \"spending\" and \"sharing\" parts yet, but I can tell that she will soon.  I intend to wait until she has a decent amount saved up, then open a bank account where we can deposit it, and use the \"share\" money on a charity of her choice.  The book suggests putting the majority of the money into \"spend\" and only 5% into the other two, but we do 1/3 1/3 1/3.  Why not?  For now, it's working great.  \n",

My 5-year old daughter and I made the chihuahua dog first, and it came out looking exactly like the picture. Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!\\n\\nThe book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.\\n\\nMy daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.\\n\\nOne thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!\\n\\nWe made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.\\n\\nPros:\\nGreat, easy directions\\nNice supplies in the kit\\nVariety - you can make so many types of dogs!\\nFun project to do with your kids\\nThe finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals\\nKids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives\\nLots of room for creativity\\nYou can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store\\nPrice - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store\\nAmazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great\\nThis kit would make an awesome present for any young girl!\\n\\nCons:\\nThe glue: this kit is a lot more fun if you invest in a hot glue gun\\nMore money :) if you love this kit as much as we do, you'll end up spending a lot more in the craft store to keep going with it!\\n\\nI hope you have as much fun with this project as we have!  \n",

                                                                                                               As a dad of two boys Im always on the lookout for activities for us to do together.  Something we can all enjoy and equally get into.  We built a Da Vinci catapult, a siege tower, did some exploring with microscopes, geocaching, etc. with varying degrees of interest in one of the two boys.  Dont get me wrong we all had fun, but it was more for one or the other depending on the activity.  My older son, since the day he could, has loved to talk.  He loves to tell stories about things hes done, things hed like to do, or things hes watched.  If he can make a story out of something, he will.  My younger son has, since I can remember, loved to play board games.  There are ones he likes more than others but I don't think weve played a game he didn't like.\\n\\nI recently became aware of a card/board game by a company out of the UK named Cubicle7.  The game is called Hobbit Tales: From the Green Dragon Inn and it looked very interesting.  Cubicle7 also makes a RPG that takes place in the same world as this game called The One Ring.  The cards in this game can be used with that RPG if desired, so its all very integrated.  The basic premise of the game is that the players are hobbits sitting around a table at the Green Dragon Inn telling stories of their adventures.  The game takes place in rounds (one for each player) and they tell the story with the aid of Adventure Cards (75 of those).  Each adventure card has a story aid, something to inspire the story teller, a title and a Tolkien quote, along with some excellent artwork to really inspire you.  However the other players have similar cards called Hazard Cards (40 of those) that they use to try to throw the story off.  Things like a goblin patrol, or a group of brigands.\\n\\nThis is the real magic of the game, when the players interact with each other in the telling of their (or each others) story.  The goal of course is to score the most points of course but the fun isn't in winning or losing the game at large.  We always count up the points and figure out who won, but thats just sort of a whatever moment.  We really enjoy the interaction and getting to tell a well flowing complete story and the opportunity to interject into others stories to tell a bit of the narrative ourselves.\\n\\nOf course there are rules that govern when you can play a hazard card, and how you decide if the hazard card was effective, but the rules are so simple it really took no more than a few minutes to get a full mastery of the games rules.  Thats a neat feat all of its own.  Most board games require much more attention to the rules.  Dont I get to shouldnt he  type of questions that make you go back to the rule book and figure out how it works again.  Not so with this.  I haven't opened the rules book since the first read through.\\n\\nSo this game fits both of my boys perfectly.  I cant imagine them liking a game more.  Its a board game and the way you play is by telling stories.  Its almost as if the game was created specifically for my family (Im a LOTR nerd, I admit it).  Ive only had the game for 3 days now and already weve played it probably 10 times or more.  No matter how many times we play it its always different (due to the number of cards there are almost unlimited possibilities).  I imagine well be playing again tonight after dinner.\\nOh, and I didn't really get into the artwork on the cards.  It is fantastic.  Some painted; some more like pen and ink drawings.  All of which feels very much like what youd expect in a Tolkien inspired game.  I believe some of it is used in the illustrations in the One Ring manuals as well (the art direction of the game has the same feel even if the game is not the same type of game.\\n\\nIve been very impressed by the selections Ive seen from Cubicle7 so far.  Im going to have to look into more of their products rather than just the ones in my wheel house (again, Tolkien nerd here).  But do yourself a favor and find this game and buy it.  \n",

In Ticket to Ride, you play one of five different friends who are obsessed with  Phileas Fogg, the man who went around the world in 80 days.  Based on Fogg's story, the players make a one million dollar bet to see who can make it to the most cities in seven days.  In the game, players can do one of three different things on their turn to travel across America:  collect tickets, collect routes, or spend tickets to travel.  When a player collects tickets, they draw one or two tickets.  These tickets can be one of five revealed tickets or from the draw pile.  If a player draws a wild card from the revealed tickets that is the only ticket they can draw that turn.  When a player collects routes, they draw three routes and must keep one.  Routes are worth positive points if a player has connected the cities on the card at the end of the game, but, the card could be worth negative points if the player does not complete the route.  The last action a player can do is spending tickets to place trains on the board.  To place trains on a path on the board, a player must spend enough tickets of the same color as the path.  Some paths are gray and allow the player to spend any color ticket as long as they spend the same color tickets.  Each time a player places trains on the board, they earn points based on how long the path is.  Play continues until one player has two or less trains in reserve.  Then all players get one last turn, and then the game is over.  After counting points from route cards the player with the most points wins!\\n\\nTheme-I'll be honest.  I've played this game a lot, but, I didn't read the story until I finally bought the game.  The story reinforces the theme decently and helps makes the title \"Ticket to Ride\" make sense.  Some of the mechanics don't quite reinforce the theme as once you have a route it doesn't leave the board.  Do you get to keep the tickets you have for that route in the game?  Do you get to keep riding the trains for free?  Why can't other players ride the same train as me?  It's not perfect, but I do feel like I'm busy trying to make it across America as fast as I can. 3.5/5\\n\\nMechanics-Ticket to Ride has some of the slickest mechanics out there.  My simple summary above is almost all the rules you need to play the game.  The game is quick, fun, and family friendly for almost all ages.  Even though the game doesn't have the insane depth of some other games, a surprising amount of strategy emerges in this game.  Since goals are secrete, you never know when your best laid plans will go up in smoke.  That tension is amazing for a simple game. 5/5\\n\\nInstructions-The instructions are four pages.  Not four pages front and back, two pages front and back.  Since the rules are not complex, the rules don't need an epic to teach the players.  I do like the art and pictures that help to teach how to play.  Brevity is the height of wit with these rules. 5/5\\n\\nExecution-The box is nice and hardy.  The path indicators are cute plastic trains that are a nice addition to the game.  The board has a nice layout and is easy to read.  AND, I know the Days of Wonder LOVES me since the game comes with plastic bags for each player's components.  I absolutely love when a company does that! 5/5\\n\\nSummary-I love this game.  It's quick, family friendly, and always good to see making it to the table.  The theme is slightly off, but the mechanics, instructions, and execution of the game make up for that hands down.  Really worth trying if you get the chance. 92.5%  \n",

                                 This game is extremely elegant, making it easy for those new to gaming to get into, but it also provides great opportunities for strategy that game lovers can appreciate. Everyone I have played it with says it was their favorite game of the night-- it is a true crowd pleaser.\\n\\nThe board is well designed- it is an oversized map of the U.S. with major cities, each linked by segmented lines of different colors. Around the edge of the board is a scoring metric, numbered from 1 to 100, to keep track of your points. Each player gets 45 plastic train cars of a given color, and a wooden cylinder of the same color to move along the scoring metric.\\n\\nEach player has two hands of cards. The first is a hand of cards with different train cars of varying color. You play a certain number of train cards of the same color to claim the \"routes\" (the lines between cities) of the same color. The second hand is made up of destination tickets. These tell you what cities you are trying to connect with your trains. These either award or deduct points from your score based on whether or not you complete them. They are kept secret until the game is over.\\n\\nThe elegance I mentioned comes from the simplicity of each player's goal (to link cities on a map using trains), as well as the simple structure of a players turn. On their turn, a player only has to do ONE of three actions: put trains on the board, draw more train cards, or draw more destination cards. You get points for the trains you place on the map, the destinations you fulfill WITH your trains, and a ten point bonus awarded at the end of the game for the longest continuous line of trains.\\n\\nHaving only one action to perform ensures players aren't wracking their brains to remember what to do each turn, and also encourages strategic thinking (if you take one action on a given turn, you have to wait til your next turn to take another). Choose carefully!\\n\\nThe educational value of this toy is twofold- you get the brain exercise of strategic thinking, and as an added bonus, you learn a bit of U.S. geography! I only marked down the durability because one of the train cars in my game arrived chipped. But they provide three extra cars for each color, so it's pretty much moot.\\n\\nAll in all, this game has something for everyone. It is simultaneously strategic and simplistic, and never gets so directly competitive that you get frustrated instead of having fun. Keeping your destination cards secret until the game is over is a great meachanic- those who scored many points by laying down trains might get passed up by those who completed more destinations, and the \"longest route\" bonus often becomes a determining factor in games. Everyone who plays is in the game the whole way through. \"Ticket to Ride\" has beyond earned the honor of \"favorite game\", and then some.  \n",

                                                       I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:\\n\\nTHEME\\nThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.\\n\\nCOMPONENTS\\nThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY\\nYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central \"bingo board.\"  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.\\n\\nSOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?\\nGlad you asked.  There's a few twists:\\n\\n1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.\\n\\n2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.\\n\\n3) After a company gets so large, it becomes \"safe\" in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.\\n\\nSO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLY\\nA few reasons:\\n\\n1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.\\n\\n2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.\\n\\n3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.\\n\\n4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is \"safe.\"  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.\\n\\n5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (\"I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?\"), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).\\n\\n6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\nAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.  \n",

Childrens Game of the Year, 2013 Parent Tested Parent Approved, 2013 Family Choice Award, ASTRA Best Toys for Kids Finalist and Sharp As A Tack Outstanding Education Value Honorable Mention\\n\\nQuiddler Junior won the 2013 Club Fantasci Childrens Game of the Year for a reason. Its fun to play while being educational and working on spelling as a child is always an important skill to have. Set Enterprises Inc. was kind enough to introduce me to several of their games during the 2013 ASTRA Toy Fair in Nashville, TN. I walked away with a copy of Quiddler Junior and they sent me more games later but it was this game that really caught my attention. I used to home school my daughter so I was very keen on checking this out and seeing its potential in mixing education and fun for the kids. That is a wonderful combination as anyone who has home-schooled can tell you!\\n\\nThe objective of Quiddler Junior is to earn the most points by spelling words from the cards in your hand. Its that simple!\\n\\nEach player starts with two cards. They draw one card from the draw pile or discard pile and then discard to end their turn. This continues until one player can use all of their cards to form a word and still discard a card to go out. Once a player goes out, each other player has one more turn to try to make a word and go out as well. After the round ends, the players words are scored with their point chips and a new round begins. Each round from here out will change by one card. In other words, the next round, each player starts with three cards, then four, then five etc.until the final round of seven cards to start with.\\n\\nWhen scoring a word, each card is worth the value of points show on its face. If a player cant score a word, they get a turkey (zero points.) There are no negative effects in this game unless a player fails a challenge. A player can challenge a word if they feel it isn't really a word. If they are wrong and it is in the dictionary chosen, then they subtract the total score of the word from their score and vice versa. If the player being challenged is wrong, then they lose the points.\\n\\nThere is also a five point bonus for the player with the longest word at the end of the game.\\n\\nAfter the last round, each player counts up all their point chips and the highest score wins!\\n\\nThere is also an alternate solitaire way to play this game included.\\n\\nNow I know this is a simple game, but it is supposed to be. It is for children. It is fast paced and it keeps the kids attention. The artwork is cute and is geared towards the young children. They will not only learn to spell from this game but also the names of objects and animals. They will learn to identify these things by picture while also learning to spell and it all being reinforced by all the resources combined. Its really a good learning tool and game.\\n\\nThis game is perfect for families with young children. You get to mix fun with learning and the kids love it! It doesnt get any better than that. Its also a great tool for home-schoolers or church groups etc. It fits well into a lot of applications for games.\\n\\nSet Enterprises is known for good solid games that are educational, fun and easy to learn. They make great travel games and Quiddler Junior is no exception.\\n\\nClub Fantasci Scoring (Based on scale of 10):\\n\\nArtwork:  7\\n\\nRules Book:  8\\n\\nRe-playability:  8\\n\\nComponent Quality: 7\\n\\nClub Fantasci Overall Score:  7.5\\n\\nI am giving Quiddler Junior 7.5 out 10 stars because it is a game that parents can easily play with children, still enjoy and teach their kids important skills at the same time. It is a very good childrens and family game.\\n\\nThis game is Club Fantasci Certified!\\n\\nCompany Website: http://www.setgame.com/Company\\n\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Set.

                                                        Originally posted at [...], a new idea everyday!\\n\\nGame-Eminent Domain\\nPrice-$40\\nProducer-Tasty Minstrel Games\\nSet-Up/Play/Clean-Up-1 Hour\\nTL;DR-Only a few faults make this game great instead of excellent. 87.5%\\n\\nBasics- Compete for the Galaxy!  In Eminent Domain, players take the roles of different groups trying to conquer the most locations across the galaxy.  This is a deck building game with a twist.  Each turn players do three things in order.  First, they can play a card from their hand as an action.  These actions either build fighters, settle planets, produce resources, removes cards from your deck, or other things.  Then, players draw one card from the central board as their role.  This new card goes into the players deck, hence the deck building aspect.  These roles produce/sell resources for points, settle attack or settle planets for points, research advanced cards with new actions, or search for new planets.  Here is where things become interesting.  When the first player selects a role, all other players may follow that role doing the exact same thing as the lead player.  For an example, if the lead player searches for more planets, they draw a card from the center and play as many cards with the search for planets symbol as they can from their hand to draw planets to settle/conquer.  All other plays may play as many cards with search for planets symbols from their hands to draw planets off turn.  After role selection, then the lead player discards as many cards as they want and draws up to five cards.  Play continues until one or two of the role card stacks is empty.  Player with the most points wins the galaxy.\\n\\nMechanics-As I mentioned above, this is a deck building game.  I like those games, but this one has the novel twist of letting all players do the same action as the lead player.  Now, if you're lucky/smart, you can take an action each turn instead of just waiting for your turn like in Dominion.  Also, the mechanics are very simple.  Play a card, draw a card and play cards that match symbols for more results, and discard/draw.  Easy as pie!  But, don't let the simplicity of this game make you think that the game doesn't have some depth to it. 5/5\\n\\nTheme-This game has a decent theme, but I don't think it oozes out of every pore.  The different ways to capture planets have diverse enough mechanics that you do feel you're doing something different when you do them. The art brings you into the game universe as you play cards.  However, the game doesn't really hammer you over the head with space conquest.  It's very subtle. 3.5/5\\n\\nInstructions-The games instructions are fairly well done, but an extra page or two would really help.  You can start playing this game in less than 10 minutes after opening the box for the first time without having played it before.  However, even I, an experienced player, still have to check board game geek if some things are allowed or intended.  The major issue has to do with symbols.  Advanced cards and planets have symbols on them.  Lots of people have questions if the advanced cards count as symbols for play.  Adding a discussion on that would have really knocked these instructions out of the park. 4.5/5\\n\\nExecution- This is well put together game.  The game has nice plastic ships!  In fact they are exactly the same ships as Eclipse.  They are as awesome here as they were there.  The box is nice, and the main play board is well done.  I like the art and card quality.  What I would like would be a bit larger play board with spaces for the advanced cards, the points, and the ships.  A little bit more would have really made this game excellent. 4.5/5\\n\\nSummary-This is an awesome game.  It's a quick deck building game that is easy to learn and play.  This game gives me a 4X feel without the 4X time or rules depth.  This game won't replace Twilight Imperium, but I promise you will play Eminent Domain far more often than that game!  This is another well done game from Tasty Minstrel Games.  \n",

You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.\\n\\nThis expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.\\n\\nTried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from \"analysis paralysis\" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.\\n\\nSome of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.\\n\\nIf you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.\\n\\nNitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!\\n\\nUPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.\\n\\nUPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.  \n",

                                                   ... not because it's not a great gateway game, but because there's an even better version out there.\\n\\nThe beauty of vanilla Ticket to Ride is its simplicity and accessibility for players of all ages and experience levels. Players can take one of three actions on a turn - take train cards (to build routes in the future), take destination tickets (to acquire new points scoring objectives), or claim routes by using the appropriate set of train cards (to score points and progress against objectives). The winner is the player that accumulates the most points for building routes and linking specific cities from their destination objectives. This simplicity allows the game to move at a very fast clip because players have usually chosen their action by the time their turns come around. However, this simplicity does not obviate the need for strategic play. Players will need to effectively balance long-term and short-term objectives, while keeping an eye on their opponents to stay one step ahead. The best part of Ticket to Ride is that you'll find yourself feeling like a powerful, cunning railroad magnate as you complete routes and destination tickets. In the end, it won't matter whether you win or lose because you'll have had an absolute blast.\\n\\nIt's little wonder that 'Ticket to Ride' is one of the most well-known and beloved gateway games. You can't go wrong by picking this one up, but I would highly recommend opting for 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' instead. The 'Europe' variant is superior in almost every way -- a better designed map and additional gameplay mechanisms that add strategic depth, mitigate randomness, and increase overall replayability and enjoyment.\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Extremely elegant gameplay mechanics\\n+ Perfect for play with kids or inexperienced gamers\\n+ Players feel a sense of accomplishment even if they don't win\\n+ Moves at a fast clip; players quickly get into the groove of pre-planning their turn\\n+ Beautiful board game with high quality, colorful game components\\n+ Just enough decision making and trade-offs for a gateway game\\n\\nCons:\\n- 'Ticket to Ride: Europe' is superior in almost every way\\n- Train and railroad theme is not for everyone\\n- Location names can be difficult to read across the table\\n- Luck of the draw can make a very big impact in regards to destination tickets\\n- Very little player interaction\\n- Works ok with 2 players, but it's not as engaging  "

       "      <td>I wish I'd watched some of the gameplay videos of Ashardalon before buying. As others have mentioned, it's not an RPG, it's a board game. But as a board game, it's a particularly bad boardgame. It's punishingly difficult, and there is little theme. It begs for house rules to clean up the terrible Encounter Card system.\\n\\nI tried playing aggressively, and was quickly overwhelmed with critters to kill. I tried playing cautiously, and my party was wrecked by encounter cards. It just doesn't feel like a proper dungeon crawl if you've killed five monsters and lost half of your characters' HP before you've left sight of the staircase. It's more like a combat game set in a wacky arena where bad stuff happens all the time. Seen another way, it is like a puzzle game, where you have to balance risk (generally too much) against reward (generally too little), and hopefully survive long enough to reach the objective. But in no way does it feel like a dungeon crawl. And, importantly, it's a poor introduction to RPG elements.\\n\\nBut clearly I am in the minority; this is a well-reviewed game. I simply wish to offer a dissenting opinion. To me, Ashardalon is not fun to play.\\n\\nI'm selling my copy and I'm going to try Mice and Mystics instead. That looks more like what I was hoping Ashardalon would be, with a balance of teen-friendly story, adventure, and combat, with no need for a DM. I'm also eager to try Arcadia Quest.\\n\\nI grant two stars in my review instead of one because the bits in the box are FANTASTIC. Excellent miniatures and board pieces. It's top-notch presentation, and looks fantastic when you take it all out of the box.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Acquire is a great game of luck, strategy, and (like monopoly) can teach people about capitalism. This new updated version from Hasbro does just that. It is a sadly cheap and flimsy copy of the original. The stock certificates are nice done. But the game board is weak, and the tiles are quite simply pitiful. Hasbro will no doubt make money, as no matter the cost to teh consumer, the cost of production must be essentiall nothing. Games are improved by the tactile: the feel of teh pieces in your hand, the way they work on the board, their physicality. This new edition was clearly designed by someone who just doesnt play board games. Sadly, its just cheap.</td>\n",

In the untold future, mankind has expanded out into the solar system, and using a unique technology that allows us to \"resleeve\" our consciousness into new physical bodies, we have all but defeated death. It's not all good, however. Extinction-level threats are amassing at all sides, and it is up to Firewall, a covert ops team destined to fight the TITANs, Exsurgent Virus, and all of the other things that go bump in the dark of space, to stop them.\\n\\nThis is an incredible game with equally incredible backstory. Buy it for the story, but keep it for the game. If you want more transhuman fiction, you can also look up the Takeshi Kovacs trilogy from Richard K.

The story is cute, the website is also cute, the doll is not the cutest by today's standards but is very reminisent of vintage Christmas ornaments. Things like my grandmother had and that were handed down to my mom when I was a little girl. If his felt were more worn and dingy, you would swear it was a family heirloom. His face is especially like the dolls and decorations from the 1930's to 1960's. Those people who get creeped out by the whole \"watching you\" aspect really do over analyze the whole good bad thing and being watched. How much emphasis is put on your child's good and bad behavior is left up to you. If you harp on the kid day and night that the elf is watching them and he is gonna rat them out to Santa, then it could make the kid paranoid, but if you simply state that what he does is help Santa keep an eye on things then you will be fine. I have 3 girls a 2 yr old, a 5 yr old and a 6 yr old. My oldest is very much a lover of all things magical. Faries, elves etc. She doesn't over think it, because she loves the magical aspect. My 5 year old is a thinker, she wants to know why things work where they go, how it happens etc. So she does over think it a bit and has her doubts. My oldest wants to believe so much she tries not to question it too much. Both girls love searching for him in the morning though. I try to keep it interesting and make my 5 year old wonder a bit more by setting the elf up in interesting situations... I put him with his head in the cookie jar with one leg propped up like he was searching for a snack when the sun came up and turned him back into a doll. I put him in the chair with the remote control in his lap and the TV on like he caught a show before morning... The kids think it is hysterical that \"Max\" is wandering around the house entertaining himself when he comes home from the North Pole. If you are the kind of parent who thinks discipline is a bad word, you don't let your kid ever drink juice, video game toys are evil and candy is the work of the devil, then this would probably not work for you. Your fragile under fed children will probably crumble at the idea that someone might find their behavior unacceptable or have horrible nightmares at the thought of an 8 inch elf coming to life and skipping off to let Santa about their behavior. He might report how Junior, in an unmedicated ADHD rage attacked his little sister who was sick in bed with the mumps, because she is unvaccinated. They have \"good\" parents who never tell their kids no, never allow those evil voodoo doctors to pump their kids full of life saving behavior balancing poisons and only allow them to eat natures candy like organic bananas and blueberries.\\n\\nIn other words it is a fun silly little thing to do with your kids if you are not an imbalanced, conspiracy fearing, child cottling, freak! Enjoy it, they only believe this stuff until they are about 8 or 9.</td>\n",

While the puzzle-building itself was enjoyably challenging, I was fortunate to be finishing it in a bright room in broad daylight.  There were many dark colored pieces that had nuanced shading, but I never would have been able to see them without the bright natural light.  Artificial light caused glares on the pieces, so it would have been very frustrating to complete.\\n\\nAs for the  mystery aspect, I was more than disappointed.  Yes, I also guessed the ending without building the puzzle, but I can live with that.  The real problem is that anyone with any knowledge about the Titanic, or any knowledge about history in general, will be frustrated with both the storyline and its correlation with the puzzle.  I'm all for suspension of disbelief (like the fact that the puzzle's recent release means that the main character would have been four years old when the Titanic sank,!), but there's no reason to miscorrelate things.  For example, and a very mild spoiler, there is a mink stole in the story that is depicted as a fox stole in the puzzle.  Why?  Additionally, one of the key (and someway senseless) details that you are supposed to \"discover\" in the puzzle picture is so dark that I couldn't even distinguish it.  I would love to add more, but I do hate to put in spoilers.\\n\\nIn summary, while the puzzle's coloration was slightly frustrating, I found myself berating the author and puzzlemakers' lack of attention to detail, both historical and practical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The One Ring is a very innovative RPG set in Middle Earth between the time of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.\\n\\nIn order to play it you need occasional reference to die rolls. Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.\\n\\nThat's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.\\n\\nWhy can't you use \"ordinary\" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper \"Feat Die\" but other than that you are good to go.\\n\\nWhy bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the \"11\" and \"12\" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.\\n\\nAlso, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the \"1\",\"2\" and \"3\" faces from the \"4\",\"5\" and \"6\" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the \"6\" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.\\n\\nNone of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.\\n\\nBesides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods.

       "      <td>Here is my review, cross-posted from boardgamegeek.com:\\n\\nI have fond memories of D&amp;D from my youth, that I occasionally attempt to recapture. I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new \"RPG-as-boardgame\" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.\\n\\nWrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!\\n\\nSadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.\\n\\nThe game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)\\n\\nThe players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they \"kick down the door\" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.\\n\\nIt's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.\\n\\nAll of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.\\n\\nThe power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The \"Hypnosis\" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's \"hypnotized\" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized \"Attack +9, Damage 1,\" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.\\n\\nIf the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of \"Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage.\" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!\\n\\nMany of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.\\n\\nWe were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.\\n\\nThe game is much more fun that way.</td>\n",

The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!</td>\n",

As others have mentioned, it's not an RPG, it's a board game. But as a board game, it's a particularly bad boardgame. It's punishingly difficult, and there is little theme. It begs for house rules to clean up the terrible Encounter Card system.\\n\\nI tried playing aggressively, and was quickly overwhelmed with critters to kill. I tried playing cautiously, and my party was wrecked by encounter cards. It just doesn't feel like a proper dungeon crawl if you've killed five monsters and lost half of your characters' HP before you've left sight of the staircase. It's more like a combat game set in a wacky arena where bad stuff happens all the time. Seen another way, it is like a puzzle game, where you have to balance risk (generally too much) against reward (generally too little), and hopefully survive long enough to reach the objective. But in no way does it feel like a dungeon crawl. And, importantly, it's a poor introduction to RPG elements.\\n\\nBut clearly I am in the minority; this is a well-reviewed game. I simply wish to offer a dissenting opinion. To me, Ashardalon is not fun to play.\\n\\nI'm selling my copy and I'm going to try Mice and Mystics instead. That looks more like what I was hoping Ashardalon would be, with a balance of teen-friendly story, adventure, and combat, with no need for a DM. I'm also eager to try Arcadia Quest.\\n\\nI grant two stars in my review instead of one because the bits in the box are FANTASTIC. Excellent miniatures and board pieces. It's top-notch presentation, and looks fantastic when you take it all out of the box.  \n",

This new updated version from Hasbro does just that. It is a sadly cheap and flimsy copy of the original. The stock certificates are nice done. But the game board is weak, and the tiles are quite simply pitiful. Hasbro will no doubt make money, as no matter the cost to teh consumer, the cost of production must be essentiall nothing. Games are improved by the tactile: the feel of teh pieces in your hand, the way they work on the board, their physicality. This new edition was clearly designed by someone who just doesnt play board games. Sadly, its just cheap.  \n",

Its worthless in every way! It never fit together. It began leaking immediately. Within 5 minutes it was a dead toy. My two little ones were so disappointed.  \n",

In the untold future, mankind has expanded out into the solar system, and using a unique technology that allows us to \"resleeve\" our consciousness into new physical bodies, we have all but defeated death. It's not all good, however. Extinction-level threats are amassing at all sides, and it is up to Firewall, a covert ops team destined to fight the TITANs, Exsurgent Virus, and all of the other things that go bump in the dark of space, to stop them.\\n\\nThis is an incredible game with equally incredible backstory. Buy it for the story, but keep it for the game. If you want more transhuman fiction, you can also look up the Takeshi Kovacs trilogy from Richard K. Morgan, which is where much of the tech in Eclipse Phase is based off of. Enjoy!\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Altered-Carbon-A-Takeshi-Kovacs-Novel-Takeshi-Kovacs-Novels/dp/0345457692/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Altered Carbon: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel (Takeshi Kovacs Novels)</a>  \n",

game does the opposite of what it was intended for. It actually has the kids focusing on ways to get angry, etc. instead of teaching how to be calm and act better. It really should have been tested before sale. A better game would have been Calm Dragon. I tried this game on kids that had absolutely no behavior or anger problems and they began behaving badly and getting angry after the second round. I don't recommend this. I am a therapist and I work with kids with anger issues all day long, I thought this might be a good tool... I was wrong.  \n",

concept!  I went to the Hallmark store and purchased one.  We loved the book but were so disappointed with the quality of the Elf.  It is not easy to place him somewhere without him tipping over.  He needs wire or something else to give him stability.  The Elf is just made of felt with some stuffing inside and a plastic face.  Since you have to place the Elf in a different area every day, I anticipate it will be frustrating since he will keep tipping over. We haven't shown the kids yet because we're thinking about returning it.  So disappointed.  \n",

The box was damaged to where it barely holds things together. They also failed to include all of the color cards, so we cant play. Instead they doubled our route cards, which is very frustrating.  \n",

pieces were card board and SMALLER the the regular sets, I love playing with Pooky. I have struggled finding the right character to play with/as in my RDI 1 and 2, my person style doesn't work with most of their characters. But Pooky is sneaky and stubborn, and not to mention adorable. My game mates have taken to \"Kill the RABBIT\" as a must.  \n",

The story is cute, the website is also cute, the doll is not the cutest by today's standards but is very reminisent of vintage Christmas ornaments. Things like my grandmother had and that were handed down to my mom when I was a little girl. If his felt were more worn and dingy, you would swear it was a family heirloom. His face is especially like the dolls and decorations from the 1930's to 1960's. Those people who get creeped out by the whole \"watching you\" aspect really do over analyze the whole good bad thing and being watched. How much emphasis is put on your child's good and bad behavior is left up to you. If you harp on the kid day and night that the elf is watching them and he is gonna rat them out to Santa, then it could make the kid paranoid, but if you simply state that what he does is help Santa keep an eye on things then you will be fine. I have 3 girls a 2 yr old, a 5 yr old and a 6 yr old. My oldest is very much a lover of all things magical. Faries, elves etc. She doesn't over think it, because she loves the magical aspect. My 5 year old is a thinker, she wants to know why things work where they go, how it happens etc. So she does over think it a bit and has her doubts. My oldest wants to believe so much she tries not to question it too much. Both girls love searching for him in the morning though. I try to keep it interesting and make my 5 year old wonder a bit more by setting the elf up in interesting situations... I put him with his head in the cookie jar with one leg propped up like he was searching for a snack when the sun came up and turned him back into a doll. I put him in the chair with the remote control in his lap and the TV on like he caught a show before morning... The kids think it is hysterical that \"Max\" is wandering around the house entertaining himself when he comes home from the North Pole. If you are the kind of parent who thinks discipline is a bad word, you don't let your kid ever drink juice, video game toys are evil and candy is the work of the devil, then this would probably not work for you. Your fragile under fed children will probably crumble at the idea that someone might find their behavior unacceptable or have horrible nightmares at the thought of an 8 inch elf coming to life and skipping off to let Santa about their behavior. He might report how Junior, in an unmedicated ADHD rage attacked his little sister who was sick in bed with the mumps, because she is unvaccinated. They have \"good\" parents who never tell their kids no, never allow those evil voodoo doctors to pump their kids full of life saving behavior balancing poisons and only allow them to eat natures candy like organic bananas and blueberries.\\n\\nIn other words it is a fun silly little thing to do with your kids if you are not an imbalanced, conspiracy fearing, child cottling, freak! Enjoy it, they only believe this stuff until they are about 8 or 9.  \n",

For those alone I can wholly recommend it.\\n\\nPast that, this is an amazing setting, set in a post-apocalyptic future with no mysticism or other cult-oriented goofiness. Humanity has been dealt a tragic blow, with so much more literally lurking in the shadows, but humanity - all of it, from basic humans to uplifts and AGI - still exists and still strives for a future. Earth is lost, although some aim to reclaim it from ruin, and everyone now dwells in the void - some more literally than others.\\n\\nI have never had any issue with my hardcopy of this book, nor any other Posthuman book; the aspects where their personal ideologies show through are corrected for in the Rimward book, which takes a close look at Jupiter and provides a more balanced look while still making it clear that the Jovians aren't exactly the best of people - any more than the various autonomist factions are saints.  \n",

. It's really messy and it isn't nearly as easy as it seems. Also, the glue is useless.\\nFor a 9 year old the instructions are very difficult.  \n",

hacking is garbage. You would think you could hack a person's brain or body with ease, but hacking is so poorly written that even with little programming experience I can tell you it's woefully underpowered. Psi is just your standard stuff, nothing new or innovative.\\n\\nThe only redeeming thing in this game is the artwork.\\n\\nAlso, the makers of this game are openly hostile towards people with the slightest difference in socio-political positions, going so far as to ban anyone who even thinks men have the slightest disadvantage anywhere in the world.\\n\\nThe developers of this game have both alienated a large portion of their (now former) fans. That is a huge mistake on their part. Don't give them your money, they don't deserve or need it.  \n",

While the puzzle-building itself was enjoyably challenging, I was fortunate to be finishing it in a bright room in broad daylight.  There were many dark colored pieces that had nuanced shading, but I never would have been able to see them without the bright natural light.  Artificial light caused glares on the pieces, so it would have been very frustrating to complete.\\n\\nAs for the  mystery aspect, I was more than disappointed.  Yes, I also guessed the ending without building the puzzle, but I can live with that.  The real problem is that anyone with any knowledge about the Titanic, or any knowledge about history in general, will be frustrated with both the storyline and its correlation with the puzzle.  I'm all for suspension of disbelief (like the fact that the puzzle's recent release means that the main character would have been four years old when the Titanic sank,!), but there's no reason to miscorrelate things.  For example, and a very mild spoiler, there is a mink stole in the story that is depicted as a fox stole in the puzzle.  Why?  Additionally, one of the key (and someway senseless) details that you are supposed to \"discover\" in the puzzle picture is so dark that I couldn't even distinguish it.  I would love to add more, but I do hate to put in spoilers.\\n\\nIn summary, while the puzzle's coloration was slightly frustrating, I found myself berating the author and puzzlemakers' lack of attention to detail, both historical and practical.  \n",

I have no problem telling my kids that St. Nick visits every kid's house in just one night using slower-than-light even-toed ungulate technology, but the idea of Claus Inc. outsourcing the Naughty or Nice list to some magic elf outfit is just wrong. Not only that, but parents are forced to become part of the child monitoring labor force because the onshore elves are lazy oafs who'll just sit in one spot without our intervention. Santa - please! Bring the list back in-house. Lower your overhead with a lean Six Sigma coal allocation methodology. Stop this madness!  \n",

My son loved it at 6 & 7, but the last few days last year he started to get scared.  Thankfully Christmas came around and Albert went home.  Fast forward to this year and he returned.  Everything was good for a day or 2, but then my son broke down and told me Albert scared him.  It probably didn't help that I put him up in the chandelier where he looked like he could jump down and attack you.  So, Albert left him a note apologizing for scaring him, told him Santa had other ways to watch children and that he'll see him next year.  This only led to another round of tears.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  *sigh*  Honestly, I'm hoping the \"out of sight, out of mind\" concept kicks in.  I'm not very creative when it comes to moving the ba$tard around.  \n",

Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.\\n\\nThat's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.\\n\\nWhy can't you use \"ordinary\" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper \"Feat Die\" but other than that you are good to go.\\n\\nWhy bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the \"11\" and \"12\" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.\\n\\nAlso, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the \"1\",\"2\" and \"3\" faces from the \"4\",\"5\" and \"6\" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the \"6\" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.\\n\\nNone of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.\\n\\nBesides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods. Nothing good comes of such reckless behavior.  \n",

                If i could give this less than one star, i would. knowing that it was used, i had expected some wear and use, but this is ridiculous. some of the pages are missing, there is scribbling in crayon and marker in some of the pages, and there are also huge chunks torn from some of the pages. in addition to that, there is a crappy \"pencil bag\" attached to the cover.... the pencil bag has no way to open it, because the prior owner ripped the zipper off. the pencil  bag contains two dull broken crayons, two used pencils, and a dried out marker with no cap. \"USE\" does not even BEGIN to describe the condition of this product. VERY dissatisfied, and would NEVER pay $10.00+ for this. It's yardsale trash, and It's getting returned.  \n",
       "1119   Here is my review, cross-posted from boardgamegeek.com:\\n\\nI have fond memories of D&D from my youth, that I occasionally attempt to recapture. I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new \"RPG-as-boardgame\" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.\\n\\nWrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!\\n\\nSadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.\\n\\nThe game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)\\n\\nThe players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they \"kick down the door\" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.\\n\\nIt's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.\\n\\nAll of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.\\n\\nThe power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The \"Hypnosis\" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's \"hypnotized\" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized \"Attack +9, Damage 1,\" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.\\n\\nIf the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of \"Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage.\" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!\\n\\nMany of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.\\n\\nWe were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.\\n\\nThe game is much more fun that way.  \n",

The game takes about 1 hour to play.  The only good thing I can say is the artwork is beautiful.  The cover belongs in a frame and should be hung on a wall. I was accused of being vindictive for blocking two other players deliberately, which is not against the rules.  When I suggested modifying some rules, which would make that type of strategy a waste, those two players said no.  I went to bed angry that night for being labeled the villain.  I was still angry the next morning, and I was angry all day at work over the game!  I haven't played it with them since. Two rules I consider most needing to be fixed are: 1. There should be no penalty for incomplete destinations. 2. Allow the use of double paths for THREE or more players. When a player's destination becomes DELIBERATELY blocked, I see the same kind of irritation you get when a player is attacked in the game of RISK, and that attack takes a continent away from them. Also, the small cars are too easily knocked around on the board.  Since I stopped playing this game, I bought Seven Wonders, which is WAY more interesting, and has no possible avenues for irritation. I did make one mistake in my review.  This game deserves ZERO stars instead of 1!!  I gave this game away, and couldn't get it out of my house fast enough!  "
